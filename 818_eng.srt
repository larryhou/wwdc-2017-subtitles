1
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,216
>> I'm sure many of us here have

2
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:24,086
found ourselves in this

3
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:24,736
situation.

4
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:27,996
You're in the bathtub, and you

5
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,396
come up with an amazing idea for

6
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:29,816
your app.

7
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,146
Or perhaps a little bit less

8
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:34,356
relaxing, you get a text message

9
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,676
from someone very important in

10
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:37,256
your organization asking you to

11
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,346
come up with amazing ideas for a

12
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:39,706
new app.

13
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,096
Looks like we are going to be

14
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:42,046
looking at Timers today.

15
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,676
So in those situations, you

16
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:46,126
might tell yourself, "I don't

17
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:46,586
have time."

18
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,296
You might want to dive into X

19
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:49,786
code, start typing out some

20
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,576
Swift, but the problem with that

21
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,756
is that once you get committed

22
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:54,576
to code, you're really deep into

23
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,806
how your app is going to work,

24
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,326
and you don't get much leeway to

25
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,856
explore all the alternatives

26
00:00:58,856 --> 00:00:59,366
that you could.

27
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:01,376
Or you might want to dive into

28
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:02,926
Sketch, and draw some really

29
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:03,856
detailed visuals.

30
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:05,986
But again, the problem with that

31
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,606
is that visuals are not

32
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:08,236
interactive.

33
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:09,486
We're building apps.

34
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,616
We want to try it as if it were

35
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:12,056
a real app.

36
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,776
So let me show you something I

37
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,896
may build after getting my CEO

38
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:17,666
asking for a Timer.

39
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,556
This is a very basic concept.

40
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,366
I tap to add five seconds to the

41
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:22,796
timer.

42
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:23,626
Let's make it 10.

43
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,546
I press Start, and it starts

44
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:26,546
counting down to zero.

45
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,226
Nothing fancy here, just an idea

46
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:30,716
I had about how the Timer app

47
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,126
might look.

48
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,456
Now, as you might have guessed,

49
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:34,686
from the title of this talk,

50
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,696
this is not a real app.

51
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:39,736
It's a prototype, and it only

52
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,676
took me 60 seconds to build.

53
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,416
That is less time than it took

54
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,396
you to brush your teeth this

55
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,656
morning...hopefully [laughter].

56
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,496
So why do we build prototypes?

57
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:53,656
We build prototypes to test

58
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,236
ideas.

59
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:55,686
Some things that seem really

60
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,446
great might turn out to be not

61
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:58,816
so great once you try it.

62
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:00,796
And some things that don't

63
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,116
appear very good at first might

64
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,486
actually have some very valuable

65
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,246
insights to them.

66
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,466
This is about saving time and

67
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,926
money by making sure that when

68
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:09,675
you commit to building something

69
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:10,826
by writing code, designing

70
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,306
assets, you're building the

71
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,000
right thing.

72
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,826
We also make prototypes to get

73
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,596
new ideas.

74
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,856
The act of making prototypes and

75
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,506
showing them to people will

76
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,666
bring new insights that will

77
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,646
help make your product even

78
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:22,946
better.

79
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:26,166
Designers love diagrams, so here

80
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,056
is a diagram of what the

81
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:28,186
prototyping process might look

82
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:28,436
like.

83
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,356
We make prototypes, we show them

84
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:33,146
to people, and we learn from the

85
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:33,716
feedback.

86
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:36,456
And we do this over and over and

87
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,846
over again, until we know we're

88
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,036
really making the right thing.

89
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,556
So let's start by making a

90
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,036
prototype.

91
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,556
Who can make prototypes?

92
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,526
Everyone. It is about using

93
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:48,086
tools that you already use every

94
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:48,346
day.

95
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:50,726
If you are a developer, you

96
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:53,016
might use X code in Swift, or

97
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,746
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

98
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:57,976
If you are a designer, you might

99
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,626
use Sketch or Illustrator.

100
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:01,986
But even if you don't code or

101
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,086
design, you can build

102
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:03,836
prototypes.

103
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:06,216
You can use keynotes, or your

104
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:07,286
favorite text processor.

105
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,756
It's about subverting your

106
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,146
tools.

107
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,136
Use tools that you use already

108
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:13,756
every day, and push them in new

109
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:14,196
ways.

110
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,956
If it can display images, and

111
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,416
respond to user interaction, you

112
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:19,956
can probably build prototypes

113
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:20,396
with it.

114
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,876
So let me show you how I built

115
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:23,696
the prototype we just saw

116
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,656
earlier, just using Keynotes, in

117
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,656
under 60 seconds.

118
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,206
Now, the video you're about to

119
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,496
see is a little fast, because I

120
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,466
like to use Keynote a lot for

121
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,896
that kind of stuff, but let me

122
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:32,496
get you through it.

123
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,116
So I start by making my document

124
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,026
the size of an iPhone.

125
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:37,776
And I'm going to draw the clock

126
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:38,616
face for my timer.

127
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,846
You'll notice I'm not using

128
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,706
really fancy design assets, I'm

129
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,216
just using basic Keynote shapes.

130
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:45,576
Let's do the same thing for the

131
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,716
button, the Start button.

132
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,376
Again, just using a basic

133
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:48,916
Keynote shape.

134
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:50,356
Let's make it green.

135
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,106
And let's make it say Start.

136
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,046
Now, I'm adding the hand for my

137
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:54,466
timer.

138
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,526
The trick I'm going to use is in

139
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:58,356
Keynote, when you rotate

140
00:03:58,356 --> 00:03:59,576
objects, they rotate around

141
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:00,136
their center.

142
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,116
So here, you see I am

143
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,976
copy/pasting the hand, moving it

144
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,306
to the lower part, and making it

145
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:04,846
invisible.

146
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,496
Now, I can group them and I can

147
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,856
rotate it and it will look just

148
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:09,926
like a hand on the timer would.

149
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,426
So we make it rotate to the 5

150
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,126
second mark for the first tap,

151
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:15,556
no easing to make it look just

152
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,196
like a real clock, and we add

153
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,526
another animation for the 10

154
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,065
second mark.

155
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,196
And finally, the last animation,

156
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:23,676
which is the hand of the timer

157
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,046
rotating all the way back to the

158
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:25,836
0 second mark.

159
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:29,396
And as this animation starts, we

160
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,566
make the Start button disappear.

161
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:32,496
And that's it.

162
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:33,456
Just like that, we have a

163
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,146
prototype that we can load on an

164
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,876
iPhone, and have it look just

165
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,876
like a real app.

166
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:43,966
[ Applause ]

167
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,206
>> So now that we've made a

168
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,116
prototype, we show it to people.

169
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,716
As we show it to people, we ask

170
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,456
ourselves, how can we make it

171
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:51,896
better?

172
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:54,666
I have some theories about what

173
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,476
will work and what won't, and

174
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,906
look for evidence that supports

175
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,076
or contradicts those theories.

176
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,236
Don't argue, defend, or dismiss

177
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,046
the feedback you get.

178
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:04,946
It is also very important to

179
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,416
show your prototypes in context,

180
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,266
on the device they're meant for,

181
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,386
in a somewhat realistic

182
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:10,086
situation.

183
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:11,736
You can't test things in a

184
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:12,196
vacuum.

185
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,556
So, for example, here I ask my

186
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,256
co-worker to test the pH of a

187
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,586
little bit of water, using the

188
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:17,996
timer.

189
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:20,806
So we add the pH reagent, press

190
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,116
the Start button, and start

191
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,116
shaking the test tube for 10

192
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:23,566
seconds.

193
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,716
So in this case, it seems to

194
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:26,966
work pretty well, right?

195
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,056
Like, it is not a very

196
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,176
complicated use case.

197
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,466
Maybe it would be nice to have

198
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,716
the Timer flash, or play a sound

199
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,286
at the end, but it seems to work

200
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:34,696
pretty well.

201
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,386
Now, my friend David used to be

202
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,306
really good at solving the

203
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,846
Rubik's Cube in high school, so

204
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:40,866
I asked him to see if he could

205
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,876
still solve a Rubik's Cube in

206
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,736
under 10 seconds.

207
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,896
All right.

208
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:52,276
Looks like he's still got it,

209
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,556
with time to spare, too

210
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,851
[applause].

211
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,556
Now, as David was using this,

212
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:58,456
there are a number of things

213
00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,366
that he was telling me.

214
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,726
He found that the Start button

215
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,246
was a little small, and hard to

216
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:02,626
tap.

217
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,726
He also thought it would be nice

218
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:05,656
if there was a countdown when

219
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,946
you press Start, so he could

220
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,246
really position himself on the

221
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,386
Rubik's Cube, and he really

222
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,896
wanted to see the actual precise

223
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,126
time, so he could tell if he

224
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,746
beat his record or not.

225
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,176
You see that this opens up a lot

226
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,726
of interesting design questions

227
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,256
around what we're building, and

228
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,036
what it should be like.

229
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,546
Once we've shown our prototypes,

230
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,566
we take a moment to step back

231
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,326
and learn from the feedback that

232
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:30,386
we have gathered.

233
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:31,916
What is working?

234
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:33,846
What is not working?

235
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,016
Do we refine what we have?

236
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:37,966
Or do we try something else

237
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:38,646
altogether?

238
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:40,306
Perhaps do some brainstorming to

239
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:41,346
come up with the next steps?

240
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:44,266
For example, here are some of

241
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,106
the questions that we got as we

242
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,146
showed our prototype.

243
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,226
Do we display the time left on

244
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,236
the timer, or the time elapsed?

245
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,826
How do you pause or stop the

246
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:54,276
timer?

247
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,336
Should we show the time in

248
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:58,316
digital form or analog form, or

249
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,036
maybe both?

250
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:02,286
And are we building a generic

251
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,836
timer, or one for a very

252
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,616
specific purpose, like solving

253
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,356
Rubik's Cubes?

254
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:10,026
And many, many other questions.

255
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,026
Now, the goal isn't to answer

256
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,266
all of those questions, but

257
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,766
rather to know what you don't

258
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,946
know, so you can then

259
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:18,456
strategically choose what to

260
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,216
pursue next.

261
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:22,326
Here is how I might improve this

262
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:23,486
prototype after showing it.

263
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,926
So, David told me that the Start

264
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,126
button was small, and the Clock

265
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,636
was hard to see, so I agree with

266
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:28,876
him.

267
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:29,796
I'm going to make it a nice,

268
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,796
bold red, and let's make the

269
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,086
hand white, just so that it

270
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:33,866
really stands out.

271
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,476
Start button is too small, so

272
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:36,166
let's do away with it

273
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,986
altogether, and maybe we make

274
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,036
the entire lower portion of

275
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,246
this, creating a tap region.

276
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:41,796
And let's make it say Start in

277
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,286
nice, bold letters.

278
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:44,746
Same color as the clock to keep

279
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:45,356
it consistent.

280
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:48,226
And I'm going to add a finish

281
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,816
screen for my timer, so we know

282
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,506
the timer is done counting down.

283
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,136
So I just add a new slide that

284
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,886
we navigate to automatically and

285
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:55,956
have it say Timer Done.

286
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,046
And just like that, we have a

287
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,436
new iteration of our prototype,

288
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,086
that we can build on, and show

289
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:01,466
to people.

290
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:06,066
Making things fast lets you

291
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,956
quickly explore a very wide

292
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,696
range of ideas and directions.

293
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,416
Here are some more prototypes

294
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,716
that I built in Keynote around

295
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:13,576
the concept of the Timer.

296
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,036
Now, some of them, as you see,

297
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,626
are aesthetic explorations

298
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,676
around what a Timer might look

299
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:19,926
like, or how you might interact

300
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,756
with it, while others are more

301
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:24,216
specific use cases.

302
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:26,256
Timers for developing film or

303
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,046
cooking a steak.

304
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,676
That is also where having a very

305
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,395
diverse team helps your process

306
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:32,765
a lot.

307
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,836
It will let you stumble upon

308
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,986
things you never would have on

309
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:36,385
your own.

310
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,635
For example, my co-worker made

311
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:41,086
this Timer to help their child

312
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:41,765
brush their teeth.

313
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:47,126
So we make quick interactive

314
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:47,896
prototypes.

315
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:49,896
We show them to people.

316
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,826
And we learn from the feedback.

317
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,956
And we do this over, and over,

318
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,796
and over again, until we know

319
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:57,836
we're doing the right thing.

320
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,386
If you start by making one

321
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,346
thing, you'll be inspired to

322
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:03,136
make a few others.

323
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:07,896
Some of these things will work

324
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,716
really well, and the ideas will

325
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,116
make it mostly unchanged

326
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:12,966
throughout your prototyping

327
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,296
process, and on to your final

328
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:14,726
product.

329
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:16,626
Most things will have some

330
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,116
aspects that work, and others

331
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,006
that don't work as well.

332
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,406
You will be able to take those

333
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,866
and modify them and recombine

334
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,406
them in new prototypes that you

335
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,756
can show and explore.

336
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:28,086
And finally, a few things won't

337
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:29,416
work at all, and it is great

338
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,166
when that happens.

339
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:31,116
You've just learned something

340
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,096
very valuable about your app,

341
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,386
and you're not going to be

342
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:36,366
spending designing time or

343
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,756
programming time building things

344
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:38,686
that would not have worked out.

345
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,226
The goal is to take ideas from

346
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,216
your head into the real world,

347
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:47,646
on device, in context, in front

348
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:50,216
of people, as fast as possible.

349
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:54,426
As you are leaving WWDC later

350
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,716
today, here are a few things you

351
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:57,136
can do.

352
00:09:58,516 --> 00:09:59,626
If you don't make prototypes

353
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,946
already, the next time you have

354
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:02,516
an idea for an app, or future

355
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,386
for your app, make prototypes.

356
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:05,536
Show them to your colleagues.

357
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:08,396
If you already make prototypes,

358
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:09,386
amazing!

359
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:09,866
Wonderful!

360
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:11,976
Find co-workers who don't, and

361
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:12,946
show them how you do it.

362
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,806
And if you manage a team, make

363
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:16,656
sure that you're building the

364
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,436
right thing, by making time for

365
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,726
prototyping as part of your

366
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,576
process and culture.

367
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:24,566
Imagine how wonderful it would

368
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,026
be if the next time you get a

369
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,426
text message like this from your

370
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,386
CEO, you can reply just 60

371
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:30,806
seconds later with a prototype

372
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:31,526
like this.

373
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:32,446
Thank you.

374
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,330
[ Applause ]
