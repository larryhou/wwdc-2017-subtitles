1
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,356
will learn how to use alerts to

2
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:27,366
make your app better, your users

3
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,596
happier, and your ratings and

4
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,616
revenues higher.

5
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:32,816
Good alerts can accomplish that

6
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,746
because they are one of the most

7
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,766
efficient problem-solving tools

8
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,976
at your disposal.

9
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,236
They help people enjoy your app,

10
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:42,986
and navigate it easily, instead

11
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,346
of getting stuck in some

12
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,306
suboptimal state, getting

13
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,976
frustrated, confused, quitting

14
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,606
your app, de-installing your

15
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:52,306
app, and giving you one-star

16
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:52,896
ratings.

17
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:56,096
So how do you create alerts that

18
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:56,386
work?

19
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:58,916
Before you get to the creating

20
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,846
part, you should ask yourself a

21
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:03,256
very important question.

22
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,006
Should I be using an alert at

23
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:06,516
all?

24
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,076
Is this the best way to achieve

25
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:09,666
my goal?

26
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,466
Let's look at some examples of

27
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,266
good alert use.

28
00:01:15,246 --> 00:01:16,626
The most common one you are

29
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,606
familiar with is to correct

30
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,086
errors, like this one.

31
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,836
Alerts are also used to request

32
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,306
access to user data, such as

33
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,156
contacts, location, or financial

34
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:30,966
information.

35
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,396
We provided a format for your

36
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:35,536
use, and put a lot of thought in

37
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,346
its content.

38
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:38,836
It explains concisely and

39
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,126
clearly what data is requested,

40
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:42,616
and how it will be used.

41
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:48,166
Alerts are also used to notify

42
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,906
people of major updates, such as

43
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:53,146
significant feature releases, or

44
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,756
critical security fixes.

45
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,896
These announcements should be

46
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,096
used judiciously and sparingly.

47
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:02,326
Reserve them only for problems

48
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,096
that merit immediate attention

49
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,056
or features that would really

50
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,735
benefit your audience, certainly

51
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,395
not every update merits an

52
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,146
alert, and on that note, let's

53
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:14,646
talk about when alerts should

54
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,456
not be used.

55
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,616
I will introduce this topic with

56
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,546
a very important point I would

57
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:22,696
like you to remember.

58
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,886
Alerts are disruptive by design.

59
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:29,836
Oops, what are you doing here?

60
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:31,066
Can't you see I'm in the middle

61
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:31,646
of a talk?

62
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,246
Don't you wish you could do this

63
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:35,676
to all annoying alerts?

64
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,356
So the lesson here is, do not

65
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,146
use alerts for non-essential

66
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:40,866
content.

67
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,566
Before putting any content in an

68
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:46,616
alert, ask yourself, do people

69
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,556
really need to know this, and do

70
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,846
they need to know this now.

71
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,486
If the answer to that question

72
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,476
is not an absolute resounding

73
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,486
yes, do not interrupt your

74
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:56,986
audience.

75
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,376
The next important point I would

76
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,276
like you to remember is that

77
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,506
alerts are lightweight by

78
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,286
design.

79
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,566
Their small format reflects and

80
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,066
serves the purpose of

81
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,916
facilitating quick, informed

82
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,786
decisions, so that people can

83
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,836
make a choice, and move on with

84
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:19,026
whatever they were doing.

85
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:22,166
Therefore, do not overload

86
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,996
alerts with lengthy content, or

87
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,106
too many choices.

88
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:29,026
These tasks are better left to

89
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,456
larger UI elements.

90
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,506
Let's look at some examples.

91
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,296
Alerts are not settings, nor are

92
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:38,926
they multiple choice questions.

93
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:42,146
You can see that the actions are

94
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,416
struggling to fit into the

95
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,556
provided format, and here is a

96
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:46,416
hint for you.

97
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:49,126
If your alert takes most of the

98
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,276
supported view port, it is time

99
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,516
to cut down or relegate some of

100
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,526
the tasks to larger elements.

101
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,636
Alerts are full-scale diagnostic

102
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:01,086
tools.

103
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,286
Do not use them to expose

104
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,606
technical data, especially error

105
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:07,056
codes.

106
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,116
Alerts are not afterthoughts.

107
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,326
Do not use them to fix

108
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,516
preventable problems.

109
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:16,726
For example, if you have

110
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,116
password rules, articulate them

111
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:21,196
clearly on the main screen.

112
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,996
You can also disallow invalid

113
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:25,006
character input.

114
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,206
However, the thing to not do is

115
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,286
to make users memorize a long,

116
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,076
complicated list of characters,

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,096
and then go back to fix the

118
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,736
problem that should not have

119
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,126
occurred in the first place.

120
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,146
To summarize, the dos and don'ts

121
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,336
of alerts, use them to correct

122
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,686
errors, request access to

123
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,756
customer data, or notify people

124
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,906
of major updates.

125
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:54,026
Do not use them for

126
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,166
non-essential or lengthy

127
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:55,826
content.

128
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,816
Do not offer complicated

129
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:58,436
choices.

130
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,596
And do not duplicate the tasks

131
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,616
of other UI elements.

132
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,826
Now, you have considered all

133
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:07,926
these factors and decided that

134
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:09,336
you need an alert after all.

135
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:12,486
So how do you go about writing a

136
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:13,376
successful one?

137
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,016
It turns out that the structure

138
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,936
of the alert, with its clear

139
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,806
separation of visual elements

140
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:22,426
already sets you on this path of

141
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:22,876
success.

142
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,166
Let's go back to our good alert

143
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,736
example, and see how we can make

144
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,836
use of that structure.

145
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:34,596
In the title, state your main

146
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,096
point in one sentence or less.

147
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,746
In the message details, provide

148
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,546
brief additional information if

149
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,646
necessary, such as the cause of

150
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,436
the error, or the reason for

151
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,246
your request.

152
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,726
Offer actions that are easy to

153
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,076
understand and perform.

154
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,346
If you have to take people

155
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,326
outside the app, or to a

156
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,306
different state, make sure to

157
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,416
navigate them there.

158
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:03,416
Do not leave this job to the

159
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,226
Back button, the Home button,

160
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:07,656
the main screen, or otherwise

161
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,586
leave users to find their way.

162
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,446
If people scan the title and the

163
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,876
actions, ideally, they should be

164
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,446
able to understand what is going

165
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,196
on without paying too much

166
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,296
attention to the message

167
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:20,946
details.

168
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,646
While this is not always

169
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:24,666
possible, it is a good goal to

170
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,686
aspire to.

171
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,286
And if you need a quick mnemonic

172
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,876
rule, a good alert answers three

173
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:32,736
key questions.

174
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,276
What happened?

175
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:36,216
Why people are seeing this?

176
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,256
And how this should proceed

177
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,066
based on the information they've

178
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,616
received.

179
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:43,646
Now that you've mastered the

180
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,476
structure of the alert, let's

181
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:47,596
practice and apply these

182
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,286
guidelines to fix some common

183
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:49,826
problems.

184
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,476
Let's read through this one.

185
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,146
"App name" cannot open this

186
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:55,846
file.

187
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,886
The title is accurate, but not

188
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,006
especially helpful.

189
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:02,066
Which file do we mean?

190
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,606
People may be working with

191
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:04,496
multiple files.

192
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,446
You may need to download the

193
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:09,146
latest available updates for the

194
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:09,316
app.

195
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,156
Do you want to visit the "app

196
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:12,226
name" website for more

197
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,626
information and troubleshooting

198
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:13,956
tips?

199
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,706
These instructions are vague and

200
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,846
tentative, and suggest multiple

201
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,966
outcomes, and that is also a lot

202
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:21,626
of text.

203
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,946
No. Yes. The actions are

204
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,026
difficult to understand without

205
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,916
going back and reading said

206
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,996
lengthy instructions.

207
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:33,096
Let's see how we can improve

208
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:33,316
this.

209
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,696
First, let's specify the file

210
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,206
name for clarity.

211
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,416
Next, let's pare down the

212
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,386
instructions for simplicity.

213
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:49,016
Finally, let's offer clear

214
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,026
actionable choices, so that

215
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,656
people understand what happens

216
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:54,756
when they tap on any one of

217
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:55,116
them.

218
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,196
Here is your before and after.

219
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,226
Which one do you think looks

220
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:01,956
better?

221
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:02,606
Thought so.

222
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,616
Now, let's take a look at an

223
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,786
alert that seems to be written

224
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,436
with all the guidelines in mind.

225
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:12,776
Let's read through this one.

226
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,746
Cancel download?

227
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,026
If you cancel now, you will not

228
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,216
receive this file.

229
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,596
Cancel? Okay [laughter].

230
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,896
There is nothing wrong with any

231
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,796
individual part, the title

232
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,886
states the question, the message

233
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:33,186
describes the consequences, and

234
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,246
even the actions use the

235
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,736
recommended terminology.

236
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,726
Cancel and okay.

237
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,496
However, this is a classic

238
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:43,366
example of a confusing alert

239
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:45,666
that happens even to the most

240
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,006
experienced developers.

241
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:50,236
So the lesson here is, even when

242
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,226
using guidelines, always check

243
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:55,006
the result for any ambiguity or

244
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:55,816
confusion.

245
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:57,836
Let's see how we can clarify

246
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:58,396
this one.

247
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,626
First, let's rephrase the title

248
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,446
to remove ambiguity and mention

249
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,806
the filename to be more

250
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:07,456
specific.

251
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,426
Next, let's apply similar

252
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,066
changes to the message details.

253
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,276
And for good measure, let's

254
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:17,716
reiterate the choices and the

255
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,566
actions, so people understand

256
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,406
what happens if they click on

257
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,086
any of them.

258
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,466
Here is your before and after.

259
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:28,216
And I hope you would agree that

260
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,696
the after looks a bit better

261
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:30,406
than the before.

262
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,876
Now, you have learned how to

263
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,246
make use of the structure, let's

264
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,406
talk a bit about style and

265
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,206
quality.

266
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,616
Here, I have a couple of tips

267
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:43,916
for you.

268
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,416
Avoid platitudes, jargon or

269
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:46,996
fillers.

270
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:48,896
All they do is take space

271
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,026
without adding any return value.

272
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,336
Use correct formatting,

273
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,406
spelling, and punctuation.

274
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,296
This seems like a very basic

275
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,386
piece of advice, but it will go

276
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,246
a very long way toward making

277
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:04,446
your alerts and your app look

278
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,106
polished and professional.

279
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,466
Finally, consider your audience.

280
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,146
Whether you are writing for

281
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,176
medical professionals, special

282
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,206
needs students, or even a very

283
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,066
smart cat who just learned how

284
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,746
to use an iPad, make sure that

285
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,756
your editorial voice matches

286
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,446
their needs and expectations.

287
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,366
In conclusion, here are the

288
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,786
three simple things you can do

289
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,496
now to make your alerts awesome.

290
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,906
Keep them simple and helpful.

291
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:37,206
Go practice.

292
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,436
Take what you learned, go

293
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,136
through your app, see if you

294
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,506
need all the alerts that you

295
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:45,386
created, and if you do, see how

296
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:46,836
you can make them work harder.

297
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,046
And for more information and an

00:10:57,976 --> 00:10:58,626
website.

302
00:10:59,226 --> 00:10:59,616
Thank you.
