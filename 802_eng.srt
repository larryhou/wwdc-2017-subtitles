00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:34,726
[ Applause ]

2
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:36,266
>> My name is Mike Stern.

3
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,056
I manage the Design Evangelism

4
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,836
Team at Apple, and it is my

5
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,506
honor to be with you today to

6
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,416
talk about design.

7
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,226
Now, at Apple, we often use the

8
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,966
term human interface to describe

9
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,546
what might otherwise be called

10
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:51,646
user interface.

11
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:55,216
Human interface is an uncommon,

12
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,056
not widely used term, but it has

13
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:01,176
a really long history at Apple.

14
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,916
Our design documentation, this

15
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,245
is the newly redesigned macOS

16
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,816
HIG, it is called the Human

17
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:09,176
Interface Guidelines.

18
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,886
This document goes all the way

19
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:17,036
back to 1978, a full 15 years

20
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,536
before I was even born.

21
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:19,756
I'm just kidding.

22
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:20,646
I'm old [laughter].

23
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,606
The word user can have a

24
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:27,126
clinical or anonymizing effect.

25
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:29,976
It narrowly defines people in

26
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,576
relation to the interface.

27
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:34,916
Human evokes a much more nuance

28
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,896
picture of who it is that we are

29
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,796
designing for.

30
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,126
If I say I'm only human, it is

31
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:41,786
to acknowledge that I have

32
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,906
imperfections, and I have

33
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:44,596
shortcomings.

34
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,846
I might fall short of your

35
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:46,996
expectations of me.

36
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:48,476
Hopefully not right now.

37
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,596
But the word human is also how

38
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:54,176
we express our highest and most

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,336
noble qualities.

40
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,186
When you acknowledge someone's

41
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,486
humanity, you're recognizing

42
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,396
their kindness, their

43
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:04,516
compassion, their generosity and

44
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:06,286
goodness.

45
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,045
Designing an interface is

46
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,776
fundamentally about serving

47
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:10,925
other human beings.

48
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:12,906
The goal isn't to make a

49
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,146
beautiful app, or a

50
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:16,476
well-organized app, or a simple

51
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:17,646
app or a focused app.

52
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:19,916
Those things are all really

53
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,556
important, but they're not the

54
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,406
real goal.

55
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:26,056
The real goal is about serving

56
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,246
the human beings or positively

57
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,926
affecting the lives of the

58
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:31,876
people who use the apps that you

59
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:32,206
make.

60
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,296
The only thing that really

61
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,126
matters is how well your app

62
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:39,586
satisfies the emotional and

63
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,716
practical needs of the people

64
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:42,786
you are designing for.

65
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,666
We have the need for safety and

66
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,616
predictability.

67
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:49,856
We have a need for knowledge,

68
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,276
for meaning, and understanding.

69
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,206
We have a need to accomplish

70
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:58,106
tasks, to achieve our personal

71
00:02:58,456 --> 00:02:59,956
and professional goals.

72
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:02,446
And we have the need to

73
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:05,256
experience beauty and joy.

74
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,946
Well-designed apps should

75
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,176
provide these things.

76
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:13,256
Well-designed apps make it easy

77
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:15,046
for people to predict the

78
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,866
consequences that their actions

79
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,416
will have.

80
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:20,646
They feel stable, solid,

81
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:22,046
trustworthy.

82
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:24,346
They help people to make

83
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,466
informed choices by providing

84
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,326
information that is clear and

85
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:28,936
helpful.

86
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:31,076
They have streamlined and

87
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,506
simplified workflows, so that

88
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,236
people can effectively and

89
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,426
efficiently accomplish their

90
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,026
tasks.

91
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,556
And they should have an

92
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,516
aesthetically pleasing,

93
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:45,586
enjoyable, and even delightful

94
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,596
experience.

95
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,516
Using apps that provides these

96
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,976
qualities is so gratifying, so

97
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,796
satisfying, you can tell that

98
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,196
the people who made the app

99
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,456
fully considered your needs.

100
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,076
You sense all the time and all

101
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,006
the effort that went into

102
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,056
figuring out how to help you get

103
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:05,736
things done quickly and

104
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:06,506
successfully.

105
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:08,436
Everything is there for a

106
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:08,886
purpose.

107
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,186
Everything is understandable.

108
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,116
It just feels so human.

109
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,625
When an app makes us feel this

110
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,836
way, we sense the humanity of

111
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:23,396
the people who designed it.

112
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,506
So how does the design of your

113
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:28,396
app accomplish this?

114
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,276
Now, when we talk about design,

115
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:34,296
we often focus on technique and

116
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:34,946
process.

117
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:36,906
And while these are important

118
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,776
considerations, they don't lead

119
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:39,806
to great designs.

120
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,886
At least not on their own.

121
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,586
Great designs are guided by a

122
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,006
deeper understanding about what

123
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:49,256
design is, at a more

124
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:52,626
fundamental, more human level.

125
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:56,206
This is what design principles

126
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,096
offer us.

127
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,646
They express core truths about

128
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,446
how we perceive the world around

129
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:02,776
us.

130
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:05,636
How we process information, how

131
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,656
we make decisions, and how we

132
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,326
communicate.

133
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:12,396
These truths are universal and

134
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,046
timeless.

135
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,026
They apply to all kinds of

136
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,276
graphic design.

137
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,166
Graphic design architecture,

138
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,386
interior design, retail design,

139
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:22,506
landscape design, landscape

140
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,196
design, automotive design, I

141
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,486
think I said landscape twice,

142
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,706
and every other type of design.

143
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,696
Design principles don't tell us

144
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,356
how to do specific things in our

145
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:35,966
design, they tell us why we

146
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,066
should do those things.

147
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,076
They serve as the foundation

148
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,956
upon which great designs are

149
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:43,236
built.

150
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,526
This session is about sharing

151
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,576
those principles with you.

152
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,276
Now, some of the things I'll

153
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,226
share today might seem kind of

154
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:56,216
basic or obvious.

155
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,796
But the most profound things are

156
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:00,896
often the simplest.

157
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,456
I've been designing for over 20

158
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:03,936
years.

159
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,666
I've been fortunate enough to

160
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,766
have worked with many brilliant

161
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,726
designers, both at Apple and in

162
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:09,776
the developer community.

163
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,066
I've had in-depth discussions

164
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,166
about a wide range of

165
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,826
interaction design challenges

166
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:17,676
across a full spectrum of apps

167
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,316
and games with people from

168
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,176
across the globe.

169
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,846
And in all of those experiences,

170
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,666
I'm constantly reminded, I

171
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,926
constantly return to just how

172
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,356
clarifying it is to evaluate a

173
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,406
design against the core

174
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,396
principles that we are about to

175
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:33,826
explore.

176
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:38,946
Okay. So, because design

177
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,066
principles are universal, I

178
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,246
thought it would be fun for us

179
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:43,966
to explore how these design

180
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,436
principles shape our experiences

181
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,406
in the real world.

182
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,856
Now, there really is no better

183
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,516
way to explore the real world

184
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,276
than to travel.

185
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,436
So, with that in mind, I thought

186
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,216
we would all go on a little trip

187
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:57,566
together.

188
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,046
Now, it took quite a bit of

189
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,596
persuading, but we managed to

190
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,126
allocate a portion of the

191
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:06,286
evangelism team's travel budget

192
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,366
to buy each one of you here

193
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,186
today a ticket to Hawaii.

194
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,826
What? Right?

195
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,356
That's pretty awesome.

196
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,766
Sandy beaches, rainforests,

197
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:19,776
tropical drinks.

198
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,556
Sounds pretty great, right?

199
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,286
Okay who is down?

200
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:23,976
Who wants to go on this trip?

201
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,206
[Applause and cheering] Yeah?

202
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,546
All right.

203
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,236
Let's go. Now, our journey to

204
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:31,856
lovely Hawaii is going to begin

205
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,726
somewhere slightly less lovely,

206
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,056
at the airport.

207
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:37,626
As we approach the airport, we

208
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,236
are going to see all sorts of

209
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:39,906
signs.

210
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,656
At first, we see signs about how

211
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:44,096
to get to our terminal.

212
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:47,216
Then we see signs that provide

213
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,706
more specific information about

214
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:49,916
what's at each terminal, and

215
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:51,886
after we find our terminal and

216
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,096
park, we head into the terminal,

217
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,946
and then we get directions to

218
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:56,446
our gate.

219
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,426
And once we get to our gate, we

220
00:07:58,426 --> 00:07:59,226
are going to know we're in the

221
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,826
right place, because there is a

222
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,736
big old sign telling us so.

223
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,436
And if we are in the wrong

224
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:05,876
place, or if our flight was

225
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,486
moved, we get directions to

226
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,396
nearby gates.

227
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:11,796
And in case there is an

228
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,026
emergency or we just want to

229
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,416
leave, nearby exits are clearly

230
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:16,716
marked.

231
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,646
The system of signs that we

232
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,446
followed is what is called a

233
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:22,606
wayfinding system.

234
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,746
Wayfinding systems help people

235
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,936
to navigate complex environments

236
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:29,616
quickly and successfully.

237
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:31,486
They are critical for helping

238
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:33,816
people feel oriented and safe.

239
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,736
People at airports are tired,

240
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,785
they're jet-lagged, they're in a

241
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,395
rush, they're stressed out.

242
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,535
So airports need to think really

243
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,236
deeply about wayfinding.

244
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:48,066
Good wayfinding systems offer a

245
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,096
comprehensive and understandable

246
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,156
list of general locations that

247
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,186
people can visit.

248
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,116
They provide needed detail about

249
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,496
what's in those locations.

250
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,126
They are highly contextual.

251
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:02,836
They become increasingly

252
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:04,936
specific as we navigate deeper

253
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,256
and deeper into the system.

254
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,436
They help people to orient

255
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:09,796
themselves by clearly

256
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:10,816
highlighting their current

257
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,646
location relative to other

258
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:13,466
locations.

259
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,486
And they provide a clear exit

260
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:16,626
path.

261
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:20,006
It's so comforting to know that

262
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,906
you can return to a place that

263
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,996
is more familiar and start over.

264
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,016
Wayfinding helps us to feel safe

265
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,226
by answering really basic

266
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,136
questions like: where am I?

267
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,126
Where can I go?

268
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,576
What will I find when I get

269
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:37,856
there?

270
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,616
What's nearby?

271
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:41,866
And how do I get out?

272
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,626
Without answers to questions

273
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,396
like these, we'd be lost.

274
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,366
Now, your app's interface is

275
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,066
really just one big old

276
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,186
wayfinding system.

277
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,176
The navigation bar, the content

278
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,446
area, the tab bar, they're all

279
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,636
just tools for providing

280
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,186
wayfinding in your app.

281
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,366
The navigation bar title and

282
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,106
selected tab bar item lets

283
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:02,966
people know where they are.

284
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,056
Tab bar in content areas lets

285
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,276
people know where they can go

286
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:08,056
and what's nearby.

287
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:11,056
Simply rendered and recognizable

288
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:12,326
tab bar glyphs and

289
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,966
understandable labels suggest to

290
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,716
people what they will find when

291
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,286
they get there.

292
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,776
And back buttons offer an exit

293
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:21,906
route, and can help people to

294
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,646
identify what area of the app

295
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:24,206
that they're in.

296
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,966
Now every screen in your app

297
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,786
should answer all of these

298
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,486
questions, or else people will

299
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,286
feel lost.

300
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,176
So go through your app.

301
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,836
Go one screen at a time, and ask

302
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,306
yourself, how well is each

303
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,506
screen answering these

304
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,026
questions?

305
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,806
Does every screen help people to

306
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:44,646
know where they are?

307
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:46,856
Does every screen help provide

308
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,846
options to people to tell them

309
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:49,766
where else they can go?

310
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,406
If some screens aren't answering

311
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,656
those questions clearly, then

312
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:55,966
there is some work to be done.

313
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,646
All right.

314
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,366
So we have a flight to catch.

315
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:01,826
Paradise awaits.

316
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,696
Wow. That was a quick flight.

317
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,056
If only they were all so quick.

318
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,506
So we have arrived in paradise,

319
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:12,556
and it's time to pick up our car

320
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:13,676
and head to the hotel.

321
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,256
What a sweet car it is.

322
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,386
It has got a sweet candy red

323
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,146
paint job.

324
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:20,386
Check out those rims.

325
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,606
Looks like it will do zero to 60

326
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,796
in like 10 or maybe 11 seconds.

327
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:27,746
It is a pretty small car.

328
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,226
If I were you, I would yell out

329
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:30,416
shotgun right now.

330
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:32,596
>> Shotgun!

331
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,936
>> [Laughs] All right, all

332
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,086
joking aside, cars are actually

333
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:36,956
quite dangerous.

334
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,716
The fact that we let people

335
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,076
drive around two-ton metal

336
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,736
objects at high velocities is

337
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:42,796
kind of ludicrous.

338
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,866
Especially when those people

339
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,876
could be tired and navigating

340
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:48,056
unfamiliar roads.

341
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,386
Now, because of the inherent

342
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:52,986
danger of driving a vehicle, car

343
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:54,326
manufacturers have to think

344
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,336
carefully about the design of

345
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,006
interiors.

346
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,916
Safety is a primary

347
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,796
consideration.

348
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,996
And so they're a great way for

349
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,396
us to learn about the design

350
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,966
principle of feedback.

351
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:08,146
Feedback helps us to operate

352
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,356
cars confidently and safely.

353
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,886
Feedback helps us to anticipate

354
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:14,776
problems that might cause the

355
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,756
car to stop functioning properly

356
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,536
or to stop moving all together.

357
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:21,466
Our vacation definitely won't be

358
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,186
very fun if that happens.

359
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,706
Now, cars provide various forms

360
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:26,126
of feedback.

361
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,036
There is status feedback to let

362
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:29,536
us know how the car is doing.

363
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,346
There is completion feedback to

364
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,526
let us know whether actions

365
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,716
we've performed are completed

366
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,456
successfully or failed.

367
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,586
Warning feedback, to tell us

368
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:39,906
about potential problems.

369
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:41,776
And there is feedback to let us

370
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,136
know when something we've tried

371
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,036
to do has caused an error.

372
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:48,506
Now, for our safety, for the

373
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,836
safety of other drivers and

374
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,876
pedestrians, the feedback that

375
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,566
cars provide must be clear,

376
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,986
immediate, and understandable.

377
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,696
So let's check out how cars

378
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,006
communicate with us, starting

379
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,196
with how they tell us about

380
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:02,976
their status.

381
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,136
Now, we have all loaded into the

382
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,036
car, and we are ready to go.

383
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,806
So looking at the gear shifter,

384
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,676
I can see that the car is in

385
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:12,076
park.

386
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,676
Knowing what gear the car is in

387
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,846
is super important information.

388
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:18,786
It is so important that it's

389
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,726
displayed twice, on the

390
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,756
gearshift, and in the instrument

391
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:23,206
cluster.

392
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,476
It would be really bad if I

393
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,156
thought the car was in park when

394
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,596
it was actually in drive, or if

395
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:30,906
I thought the car was in drive,

396
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,756
when it was actually in reverse.

397
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,326
Other status feedback lets me

398
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,856
see the fuel level, so I can

399
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,986
anticipate and predict how far

400
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,516
we can go before we need to

401
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:41,076
refuel.

402
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,686
And seeing our current speed

403
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,876
helps me to avoid getting costly

404
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:46,786
speeding tickets.

405
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,076
These are two really critical

406
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,226
pieces of information.

407
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,596
I don't want to run out of gas

408
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,296
before we get to the hotel, and

409
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:54,586
the lovely folks in finance have

410
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,606
told me repeatedly that I cannot

411
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,186
expend speeding tickets.

412
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,836
Now, status information in apps

413
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:02,276
should be just as clear.

414
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,426
So, for example, in the mail

415
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,386
app, unread status indicators

416
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,216
help people to prioritize which

417
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,856
emails to read first.

418
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,426
In Calendar, status indicators

419
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,216
help people to see when someone

420
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,076
can't make a meeting and it

421
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:17,176
helps them determine if they

422
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,126
need to reschedule.

423
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:20,256
In the Camera app, there are

424
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,096
three elements to let people

425
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:23,366
know that a video is being

426
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:23,926
recorded.

427
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,036
The red dot, the incrementing

428
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,506
time code, the state of the

429
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:28,356
record button.

430
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,916
They all let people know that a

431
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,636
precious but fleeing moment is

432
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:34,486
being recorded.

433
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,676
Showing status clearly and

434
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,196
directly is crucial for saving

435
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:42,406
people time and helping them to

436
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,786
avoid making mistakes.

437
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:46,466
Next up is completion feedback.

438
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,006
We are ready to go, so I start

439
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:49,406
the car [engine starts].

440
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,836
We can hear the engine turn

441
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,136
over.

442
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,576
We can feel the vibration of the

443
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:57,256
motor running.

444
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,036
We see that instrument cluster

445
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:00,986
come to life.

446
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,316
There is no doubt that we are

447
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,066
ready to go.

448
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,556
And as I shift, from Park into

449
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:11,126
Drive, I get tactile feedback to

450
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:12,436
let me know that I'm moving

451
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:13,446
through those gears.

452
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:15,466
And as we pull out of the

453
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,326
parking spot, we hear [clicking]

454
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,246
the doors lock.

455
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:21,846
This happens automatically, so

456
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,586
it is even more important that

457
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,626
we get this feedback.

458
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,916
All of this feedback is

459
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,696
reassuring.

460
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,116
It's our car's way of saying it

461
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:32,206
is all good, I'm doing exactly

462
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:33,786
what it is that you wanted me to

463
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:35,816
do, and this frees me up to

464
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:37,946
focus on other cognitive tasks,

465
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,956
like making sure it's safe to

466
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,286
pull out of the parking spot.

467
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,966
Completion feedback in apps

468
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,776
serves the very same purpose.

469
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,136
The sound of a locked iPhone

470
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:48,696
[clicking].

471
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,846
The animation of an email being

472
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,606
marked as unread, or the

473
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,336
animation of an email being

474
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:56,756
deleted.

475
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,326
These cues are discreet, and

476
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,536
they're non-invasive, but

477
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,136
they're hard to ignore, and they

478
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,226
provide that necessary

479
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:05,206
reassurance that our devices are

480
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,756
performing as expected.

481
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,716
Of course, confirmation feedback

482
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,366
can be even more obvious.

483
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,096
The animation and sound of a

484
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:14,966
successful Apple Pay transaction

485
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:15,316
[tone sounds].

486
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,486
It's very hard to miss.

487
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,926
Every action taken in your app

488
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:22,636
should provide some form of

489
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,376
confirmation feedback, because

490
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,896
it is absolutely necessary for

491
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,316
letting people know that actions

492
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:28,686
they've performed were

493
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:29,326
successful.

494
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,036
Warnings help people to

495
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,416
understand in advance about

496
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,366
potential errors.

497
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:36,096
Low fuel level.

498
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,706
Low break pads.

499
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,106
Low oil level.

500
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:41,706
Warnings can be communicated

501
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,126
using status indicators,

502
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,816
messages, and the instrument

503
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,206
cluster, built-in display,

504
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,426
sounds, or all of the above.

505
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:50,956
These warnings are important.

506
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,766
They keep us safe, and they

507
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:55,106
protect our car from damage.

508
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,246
And lastly, error feedback in

509
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,996
cars, as with apps, is crucial.

510
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,136
If you try to start a car

511
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,086
without gas, you will get an

512
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:06,326
error message about that.

513
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,866
Now errors are always

514
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:10,846
disappointing and frustrating.

515
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:12,965
It's best to help people avoid

516
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,136
making errors in the first

517
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:14,556
place.

518
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:17,066
Warnings and confirmation

519
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:17,925
feedback can help.

520
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,316
For instance, in-line form

521
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:21,685
validation is a fantastic

522
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,195
technique for letting people

523
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,445
know what values will be

524
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:27,116
accepted, and what values will

525
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:27,346
not.

526
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:29,846
Getting this feedback in real

527
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,706
time helps people to course

528
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:32,986
correct so that they don't run

529
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,106
into errors later.

530
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,006
You can also try to infer what a

531
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,946
person was wishing to do, or

532
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,936
what they intended to do when

533
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,756
they made a mistake, and then do

534
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,066
something reasonable.

535
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:47,176
So, for example, in the new

536
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,666
version of Things 3, if you type

537
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,586
in the date June 31st, which by

538
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:53,656
the way is a date that does not

539
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,346
exist, but it's a common mistake

540
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,226
for people to make, the app

541
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,536
doesn't throw up an error or

542
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,576
show a warning.

543
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,236
No. Instead, it automatically

544
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,316
corrects the date to July 1st.

545
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,226
It's such a subtle thing.

546
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,516
It's kind of brilliant, and it's

547
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,566
a very human thing to do.

548
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,556
Now, as you can see, clear,

549
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:17,266
timely, and understandable and

550
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,836
informative feedback is

551
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:19,376
essential.

552
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,776
Feedback answers super important

553
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:22,426
questions.

554
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,086
What can I do?

555
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,286
What just happened?

556
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:28,876
What is currently happening?

557
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,176
And what will happen in the

558
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:31,646
future?

559
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:35,376
Many apps do not do a very good

560
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,706
job of providing feedback.

561
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,306
The reason for this, I think, is

562
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,536
that when you're designing, it

563
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:42,816
is so easy to start to think

564
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,636
about static screens, and you

565
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,076
can lose sight of the fact that

566
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,816
interactive experiences happen

567
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,506
over time, with lots of back and

568
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:50,926
forth.

569
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:53,866
Good feedback is like having a

570
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,406
conversation with the person who

571
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:55,966
designed it.

572
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,866
As a designer, feedback is your

573
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:01,126
way of letting -- answering

574
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:03,056
people's unspoken questions.

575
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:05,016
It is your way of letting people

576
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:06,656
know how they're doing, and

577
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:07,896
providing helpful guidance to

578
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,106
them.

579
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,706
So when designing your app,

580
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,546
imagine that you're having a

581
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,876
conversation with the person who

582
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:15,346
is using it.

583
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,916
What would you say if you were

584
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,266
in the room with them?

585
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:21,126
How would you say it?

586
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:23,996
I have a very simple, but highly

587
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,146
effective technique to share

588
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:25,496
with you.

589
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,456
Ask someone who has never used

590
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:28,596
your app before to use it.

591
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,736
Have them tell you what they are

592
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:31,996
thinking, what they think is

593
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,696
unclear, what they find to be

594
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:34,356
confusing.

595
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,896
Then simply explain to them how

596
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,586
your app actually works.

597
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,756
Guide them along, explain to

598
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:43,546
them what's happening, and what

599
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:44,826
they should be paying attention

600
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,086
to.

601
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,186
Then step back.

602
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,156
Consider how what you've said

603
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,766
might differ from what the app

604
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:52,756
is communicating.

605
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,886
In my experience, when someone

606
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:56,576
needs to explain their design to

607
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,886
me, it is usually so much more

608
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:02,976
clear than the design itself.

609
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,226
What people tell me fills in the

610
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,006
gaps that are left by their

611
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:06,526
design.

612
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,096
We tend to be much better

613
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,856
communicators when we're sitting

614
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,906
with someone in person to try to

615
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,536
capture that experience.

616
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:16,826
Okay, so that is feedback.

617
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,916
Now, the next design principle

618
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,676
is closely related to feedback,

619
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,516
and that is the principle of

620
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,296
visibility.

621
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:26,156
Good feedback does not matter

622
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,836
very much if people can't see

623
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:27,986
it.

624
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,666
Visibility captures something

625
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,756
very obvious.

626
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,126
The usability of a design is

627
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,516
greatly improved when controls

628
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,446
and information are clearly

629
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:38,966
visible.

630
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:41,596
See? It's kind of obvious.

631
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:43,766
Consider how important

632
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,776
visibility is in your car.

633
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,036
The instrument cluster presents

634
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:49,486
status information and warning

635
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:51,366
indicators directly in front of

636
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:51,596
you.

637
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,766
Instrument clusters are visually

638
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:54,196
cluttered.

639
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:55,196
There's all sorts of text, and

640
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,716
numbers and moving gauges and

641
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:57,786
blinking lights and status

642
00:20:57,786 --> 00:20:58,436
indicators.

643
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:00,966
They're not called clusters

644
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,756
without reason.

645
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:05,256
But all of this is necessary for

646
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:07,416
operating a vehicle, and needs

647
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,316
to be plainly visible, without

648
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,906
you having to move your head or

649
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:12,346
your body.

650
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,106
Hiding some of this information

651
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,076
or putting it elsewhere in the

652
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,276
car would hurt usability.

653
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,526
Critical feedback would just get

654
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,676
ignored, and the same is true

655
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:24,386
for apps.

656
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,576
In the Mail app, badges provide

657
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:29,426
helpful status information about

658
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:30,456
email messages.

659
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,156
Removing that information might

660
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,026
reduce clutter.

661
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,746
It could look a little bit

662
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,196
cleaner, but it would greatly

663
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,196
reduce usability.

664
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,136
People would have to navigate

665
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,666
into each email message to get

666
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,486
that information.

667
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,506
It would be very inefficient,

668
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:47,126
and it would be very tedious.

669
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:49,326
So it is important to surface

670
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,376
key status information at higher

671
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,216
levels whenever possible.

672
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,176
Or, consider the navigation in

673
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:56,726
the Clock app.

674
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:59,566
What if that was hidden into a

675
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:00,366
hamburger menu.

676
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:02,726
People would have a much harder

677
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:04,996
time seeing what other functions

678
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:06,796
the Clock app offers to them

679
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,486
beyond what is currently

680
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:08,966
visible.

681
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,716
Obviously there is a tradeoff

682
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:11,976
here.

683
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:14,376
Densely packed interfaces can be

684
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,926
overwhelming and they can slow

685
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:18,016
decision-making, especially for

686
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,286
people who are new to your app.

687
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:22,216
So visibility has to be weighed

688
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,636
against other considerations.

689
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:27,166
Now, with so many of us in the

690
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,996
car, I'm starting to feel a

691
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:31,086
little bit cramped, and I cannot

692
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,686
wait to get to the hotel, but

693
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,736
there is one more insanely

694
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,736
important design principle to

695
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,746
point out while we're here, and

696
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:40,496
that is about consistency.

697
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:43,826
The principle of consistency is

698
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:45,586
about representing similar

699
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:48,746
design features in similar ways.

700
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,516
If you've driven a car before,

701
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,426
there are symbols and terms that

702
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,626
you are no doubt familiar with.

703
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:56,476
You will recognize the symbols

704
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,396
for door lock, for window, for

705
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:01,296
gas, headlights, battery, oil,

706
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:02,386
and so forth.

707
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:04,596
You will be familiar with the

708
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,906
definitions of words like Park,

709
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,776
Drive, and Reverse, as they

710
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:10,356
apply to the operation of a

711
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:10,866
vehicle.

712
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,976
Consistency also applies to the

713
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,886
location and the configuration

714
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:16,716
of controls.

715
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,086
We all expect the brake to be on

716
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,306
the left, and the accelerator to

717
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:22,206
be on the right.

718
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,396
Consistency greatly improves the

719
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,716
usability of a vehicle, or maybe

720
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,856
it is more clear to just flip

721
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:30,846
this around and say that

722
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,956
inconsistency undermines

723
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,016
usability.

724
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:38,236
Whoops. All cars share a common

725
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:40,266
design vocabulary for these

726
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,426
symbols and terms.

727
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:43,996
All cars position controls in a

728
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,436
relatively consistent way, and

729
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,546
because of this consistency, we

730
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:48,846
don't have to re-learn how to

731
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,686
drive a car every time we get

732
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,116
behind the wheel of a new one.

733
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,786
Now, maybe this is obvious, but

734
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:57,086
consistency is actually hard to

735
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:57,486
achieve.

736
00:23:58,216 --> 00:23:59,866
You have to make a conscious

737
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:02,956
effort to be consistent, and you

738
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:04,856
have to be consistent with the

739
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:05,546
right things.

740
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,316
You have to fully consider what

741
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,786
expectations people have when

742
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:10,636
they come to your app.

743
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,046
Those expectations are mostly

744
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,176
informed by their experiences

745
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:16,556
with the other apps that they

746
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,176
use.

747
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:19,536
The other apps that they use,

748
00:24:19,536 --> 00:24:20,706
how do you figure that out?

749
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,176
Of course, it is impossible for

750
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:22,756
you to know.

751
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:25,696
But you can make some informed

752
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,276
guesses.

753
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:28,426
Perhaps they've used other apps

754
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,676
that are similar to the things

755
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,686
that your app does.

756
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:31,836
Maybe not.

757
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:34,796
But it's very likely that they

758
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,096
have used other apps on the

759
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,766
platform.

760
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:38,706
So you should pay attention to

761
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:40,156
platform conventions.

762
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,846
Things like iconography and

763
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,106
terminology, navigation schemes,

764
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:47,686
and even common work flows for

765
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,646
typical tasks.

766
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,926
Now, let me give you just one

767
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,596
example to make this, I think, a

768
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:54,876
lot more concrete.

769
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:57,996
On iOS, the glyph that we use to

770
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,676
represent the concept of an

771
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,796
action is an arrow that points

772
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,296
up and away from a box.

773
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:05,916
Because the most common action

774
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,016
associated with this glyph is

775
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:10,006
share, we affectionately call

776
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:11,456
this a "sharrow."

777
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,966
I love that name.

778
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:16,626
Now, some apps use a different

779
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,566
icon to represent a similar

780
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:19,146
concept.

781
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,846
This icon is commonplace.

782
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,736
It is used on websites and other

783
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:24,426
platforms.

784
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,476
Now, this is a great glyph.

785
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:28,016
Do not get me wrong.

786
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:29,486
There is nothing wrong with this

787
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,376
glyph at all.

788
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,916
But it's not the symbol that iOS

789
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,556
users are most familiar with.

790
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,536
This glyph shows up in iOS apps

791
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,596
because of the desire to be

792
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:41,836
consistent, to consistently

793
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:43,436
represent this concept in a

794
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:46,536
consistent way across platforms

795
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:47,706
or with your website.

796
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:51,086
This is a perfectly rational and

797
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:53,276
reasonable thing to do, but it

798
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:54,566
is not the right call.

799
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,566
From the perspective of the

800
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:57,826
person who you are designing

801
00:25:57,876 --> 00:25:59,956
for, it is best to be consistent

802
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:01,186
with the symbol that they are

803
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,236
most familiar with.

804
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,406
Being consistent will go a long

805
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:07,476
way towards making your app more

806
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,206
approachable and usable.

807
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:13,066
Now, look, there is always the

808
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,666
impulse to, you know, do things

809
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,546
a little bit different.

810
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,486
And to be clear, this is a

811
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,606
really good thing.

812
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:24,116
You should absolutely be trying

813
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,566
out new ideas.

814
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,216
That's how innovation happens.

815
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,136
But inconsistencies about simple

816
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:32,276
things, like icons and labels,

817
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:33,696
can really trip people up.

818
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,126
So it's always best to be

819
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:37,556
consistent unless you have a

820
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,046
very strong justification to do

821
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:40,676
otherwise.

822
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:43,026
Now, I'm sure you're all

823
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,176
consistently ready to get out of

824
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:45,406
this car and get to the hotel,

825
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:46,736
but there is one last point

826
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:47,936
about consistency that I'd like

827
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,416
to make, and it is about

828
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,486
internal consistency.

829
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,436
Internal consistency is about

830
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:55,386
designing controls to share a

831
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,356
similar look and feel, that

832
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:58,166
match each other.

833
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:00,886
Your app's glyphs should have a

834
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,566
consistent visual style.

835
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,776
Text in your app should have a

836
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:06,606
limited number of font faces and

837
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:09,156
sizes and colors and so forth.

838
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,476
Internal consistency helps to

839
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,286
make an app feel cohesive or

840
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:15,746
whole.

841
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,416
When everything matches, when

842
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,296
everything fits, people are

843
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,726
given a deeper sense of a

844
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:23,096
product's integrity.

845
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:25,886
We intuitively believe that

846
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:28,056
design choices were deliberate

847
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,856
and thoroughly considered.

848
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:32,336
And with very good reason.

849
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:34,166
Being consistent takes

850
00:27:34,476 --> 00:27:36,306
self-control and restraint.

851
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,046
All right, now because our car

852
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:40,606
was so darn consistent, we

853
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:42,396
finally managed to arrive safely

854
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:43,206
at the hotel.

855
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,076
That car ride was really stuffy.

856
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,546
So you decide to head up to your

857
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,366
room and freshen up a little

858
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:49,736
bit.

859
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,456
Perhaps you go throw on that

860
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,426
fresh new Aloha shirt you picked

861
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:54,196
up at the airport.

862
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,296
So, when you get to your room,

863
00:27:56,796 --> 00:27:58,776
you head to the bathroom, and

864
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,266
you turn the handles on the

865
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,256
faucet and let the water run a

866
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:03,726
little bit.

867
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:05,126
And after a couple of seconds

868
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:06,546
you put your finger under the

869
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,786
water to check the temperature.

870
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,346
It's still a little bit cool, so

871
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:11,516
you increase the hot water a

872
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:12,036
little bit.

873
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,676
You wait another couple of

874
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,146
seconds, and the water warms up,

875
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,136
and you commence face washing.

876
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,536
You feel refreshed and

877
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:21,396
reinvigorated.

878
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,926
Compared to driving a car, a

879
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:26,906
faucet is really basic.

880
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,366
But at some point, you had to

881
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,846
learn how to use a faucet.

882
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:32,886
You learned by adjusting the

883
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,376
controls of various faucets and

884
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:35,886
observing the results.

885
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,226
For example, how do you know

886
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,496
which handle controlled the hot

887
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:39,876
water?

888
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,776
You knew because for the most

889
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,576
part hot water is controlled by

890
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:45,776
the handle on the left.

891
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:48,526
And why would you keep testing

892
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,726
water temperature for a few

893
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:50,186
seconds?

894
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,076
You did this, because you expect

895
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,286
there to be a delay between when

896
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:54,836
you adjust the temperature and

897
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:56,136
when the water actually gets

898
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:56,576
warmer.

899
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:59,576
Looking at the water, it is

900
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,046
really hard to tell if the water

901
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,546
is cold or hot, and we have all

902
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:05,036
experienced burning our hand

903
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:05,916
under a faucet.

904
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:08,286
Now, you don't think about these

905
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,966
things every time you use a

906
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:10,516
faucet.

907
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,826
You just intuitively expect

908
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:12,996
them.

909
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:16,186
Within each of your brains,

910
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,346
there is this tiny, little

911
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:22,376
adorable model of a faucet, and

912
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:24,576
that model represents the faucet

913
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:27,046
as a system of parts and

914
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:28,916
functions and behaviors.

915
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,366
There is a spout for producing

916
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:34,016
water, there's handles for

917
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,146
controlling temperature and

918
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:35,486
flow.

919
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,986
Those parts are arranged in

920
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,446
specific configuration, and your

921
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,116
model has certain behaviors,

922
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,806
like the latency between when

923
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:46,326
you adjust the hot water, and

924
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,116
when the temperature of the

925
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:48,856
water actually increases.

926
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:52,206
This model is referred to as

927
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,736
your mental model.

928
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,516
You have a mental model of every

929
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:57,666
system that you've ever

930
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:58,396
interacted with.

931
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:00,676
Those mental models are

932
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,026
over-simplifications.

933
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:03,846
They don't fully capture the

934
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,426
inner workings of these systems.

935
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:07,116
Though, the more experience you

936
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,956
have with a system, the more

937
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:12,586
sophisticated your model

938
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:12,976
becomes.

939
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:13,886
Mental models are developed

940
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,276
through personal experience, and

941
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,686
they're based on an incomplete

942
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:18,876
set of facts, so everyone's

943
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:20,426
mental model is unique.

944
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,546
Now, real quick, there is

945
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:24,366
actually two parts of a mental

946
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,496
model that are worth

947
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:26,716
understanding separately.

948
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,146
A system model is the model

949
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,616
about how a system works.

950
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:33,816
Our system model might involve

951
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,296
thinking about two independent

952
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,146
sources of water, one hot, and

953
00:30:37,146 --> 00:30:37,806
one cold.

954
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,196
And the system allows those

955
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:41,956
inputs to be mixed, to create a

956
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,096
range of temperatures.

957
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:45,226
The system is not immediately

958
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:45,996
responsive.

959
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:47,176
Changes to temperature could

960
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:48,226
take a little bit of time,

961
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:50,696
especially when we first turn on

962
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:51,526
the faucet, right?

963
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,326
Our system model includes this

964
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:55,466
understanding of variable

965
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:56,726
latency and temperature.

966
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,086
Okay. The other term is

967
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:01,166
interaction model.

968
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,456
Now, does anyone care to guess

969
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,026
what that model is?

970
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,796
Just go ahead and shout it out.

971
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:08,456
No, I'm just kidding.

972
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:10,406
Okay, you guys didn't fall for

973
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:10,496
that.

974
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:11,176
You're a smart crowd.

975
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,626
If you guessed that it's a model

976
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:15,086
about how we interact with the

977
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:17,026
system, then you are correct.

978
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:20,146
Our interaction model is that we

979
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:21,776
adjust the temperature and water

980
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,406
flow with the handles that are

981
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:23,936
provided.

982
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,706
Okay, so now that we know a

983
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:28,416
couple of fancy terms, you might

984
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,036
be wondering how all of this is

985
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:30,776
relevant to you?

986
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:34,316
Well, when a system such as a

987
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:36,526
faucet matches our mental model,

988
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,036
then our expectations of that

989
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:38,716
system are met.

990
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:40,786
When this happens, and we're not

991
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:42,346
really conscious of our own

992
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:44,676
expectations, we perceive the

993
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,306
system to be intuitive.

994
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,766
Conversely, when a system

995
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:51,276
doesn't match our mental model,

996
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,376
it breaks our expectations, and

997
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:54,726
we perceive it to be

998
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,696
unintuitive.

999
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:58,626
Now, let's just sit with this

1000
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,726
concept for a second.

1001
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:01,856
Because it's a really, really

1002
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,466
important one in design.

1003
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:06,636
And to do that, I would like to

1004
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:08,296
share with you a little story

1005
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:11,416
about a faucet designer named

1006
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:12,056
Mortimer.

1007
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:15,906
Now, like all of you, Mortimer

1008
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:17,806
has a mental model of faucets.

1009
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:20,096
Though obviously Morty's mental

1010
00:32:20,096 --> 00:32:22,246
model is way more sophisticated,

1011
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:24,536
and way more bad ass than yours.

1012
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:26,806
I'm just being real with you, he

1013
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:27,876
is a faucet designer for a

1014
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:28,246
living.

1015
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,916
Now, consider that job that he

1016
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,316
has.

1017
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,856
His job is all about making

1018
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:35,766
amazing, best in class,

1019
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:38,536
delightful faucet experiences.

1020
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:41,146
And one day, like a bolt of

1021
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,156
lightning, he's struck with this

1022
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:45,086
amazing idea.

1023
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,346
We have been doing this faucet

1024
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,576
thing all wrong.

1025
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:51,396
He has a new concept about how

1026
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:52,616
to make things better.

1027
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:55,646
Instead of using one handle for

1028
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,466
hot water flow, and another

1029
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:59,766
handle for cold water flow, we

1030
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:01,286
should just have one lever to

1031
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:02,936
control temperature, and the

1032
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,526
other should control flow.

1033
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:06,066
This way people won't

1034
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,156
accidentally increase or

1035
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:08,166
decrease temperature when they

1036
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,586
are adjusting flow and vice

1037
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:09,956
versa.

1038
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,096
It is brilliant.

1039
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,926
This is why they pay Mortimer

1040
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:16,716
the big bucks.

1041
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,316
Now, at this point, Morty has

1042
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,836
this new and super awesome

1043
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,516
mental model about faucets in

1044
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:24,116
his mind.

1045
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,466
Unfortunately, there is just one

1046
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:30,066
tiny little problem.

1047
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,846
Morty's mental model doesn't

1048
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,236
match the mental model that

1049
00:33:33,236 --> 00:33:34,936
people have about faucets.

1050
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:37,086
When people use the Morty

1051
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:38,646
faucet, it doesn't match their

1052
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:41,116
expectations at all and they say

1053
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,316
it is unintuitive.

1054
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,726
What is worse, the Morty faucet

1055
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:47,596
looks nearly identical to a

1056
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,526
regular faucet, but it behaved

1057
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:50,606
totally different.

1058
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:52,836
When people turned on the hot

1059
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:54,766
water, no water came out.

1060
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:57,756
This mismatch between expected

1061
00:33:57,756 --> 00:34:00,076
behavior and experienced reality

1062
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,096
created a major usability

1063
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:02,606
problem.

1064
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,146
Perhaps alterations to the

1065
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,556
faucet's form could suggest that

1066
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:07,876
it had a different interaction

1067
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:08,235
model.

1068
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,766
Maybe adding labels would help,

1069
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:13,616
but these are just remedies to a

1070
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,416
deeper issue.

1071
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,716
Labels and subtle variations of

1072
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:18,466
form are design cues that can

1073
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:20,226
easily be overlooked, especially

1074
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,746
when people have deeply

1075
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:23,806
ingrained notions about how a

1076
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,416
system works, and how they

1077
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,176
interact with it.

1078
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:29,966
This is a big issue in app

1079
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:30,366
design.

1080
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,386
Trust me, I have been there more

1081
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:33,835
than once.

1082
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,576
Trying to get people to change

1083
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,146
their mental model of how your

1084
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:39,606
app works is risky.

1085
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,226
This becomes even more true the

1086
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:43,735
more familiar people are with

1087
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:44,426
your app.

1088
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,775
Changes to any long-lived

1089
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:49,146
existing product will inevitably

1090
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,806
be hard for people to adjust to.

1091
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:52,376
It really doesn't matter how

1092
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:54,286
good or how necessary those

1093
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:55,036
changes may be.

1094
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:57,896
When considering big changes to

1095
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,886
an existing app, you have to be

1096
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:02,456
100 percent positive that those

1097
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:04,196
changes will lead to clear wins

1098
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:05,766
for the people who currently use

1099
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:06,376
your app.

1100
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,706
Making changes just for the sake

1101
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,096
of it is not a good

1102
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:10,966
justification.

1103
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,376
Go carefully.

1104
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:13,606
Test your design.

1105
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,226
Prove to yourself beyond a

1106
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,286
shadow of a doubt that your

1107
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:19,086
innovations are objectively

1108
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:19,446
better.

1109
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,696
If you can do that, then it's

1110
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:23,546
good to push through.

1111
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:24,936
People will come around

1112
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:25,606
eventually.

1113
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:30,116
Okay. So it's time to start

1114
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:31,206
getting ready for dinner.

1115
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:33,016
So you decide to throw on that

1116
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:35,666
dope new Aloha shirt, and you

1117
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,146
exit the bathroom and you turn

1118
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:38,726
off the lights by flipping a

1119
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:39,166
switch.

1120
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:41,226
The sun is setting outside.

1121
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,586
It is a bit dark, so you turn on

1122
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:44,556
a light in the hallway.

1123
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:46,696
Then you walk over to the

1124
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,596
bedroom and you flip on another

1125
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:50,826
couple of light switches to turn

1126
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,036
the lights on out there.

1127
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:54,716
This, in a nutshell, is the

1128
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:56,986
design principle of proximity.

1129
00:35:58,146 --> 00:36:00,296
Proximity is about the distance

1130
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,506
between a control and the object

1131
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:03,546
that it affects.

1132
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:06,506
The closer a control is to that

1133
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:08,946
object, the more we assume there

1134
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:11,156
to be a connection between the

1135
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:11,446
two.

1136
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:14,076
Of course the bathroom light

1137
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:15,066
switch is in the bathroom.

1138
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,636
Of course the hallway light

1139
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:17,486
switch is in the hallway.

1140
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,126
Of course the bedroom light

1141
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:21,696
switch is in the bedroom.

1142
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,506
Greater proximity also makes

1143
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:24,576
ergonomic sense.

1144
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,356
In general, the closer you are

1145
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,566
to an object or region of

1146
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:29,166
interest, the more likely you

1147
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,086
are to want to interact with it

1148
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:32,296
and control it.

1149
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:33,946
People think to turn on the

1150
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:35,136
bathroom light when they walk

1151
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:35,886
into the bathroom.

1152
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,056
So, by putting the light switch

1153
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,786
right by the door, it is within

1154
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,136
arm's reach when they need it

1155
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:40,606
most.

1156
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,116
Proximity is also useful for

1157
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:46,076
expressing relationships between

1158
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:46,606
controls.

1159
00:36:47,156 --> 00:36:48,436
So, for example, if you see a

1160
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:50,526
set of switches on the wall, and

1161
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:51,846
you know that one of them

1162
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:54,026
controls lights, then it's

1163
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,546
reasonable for you to assume

1164
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,366
that every switch is a light

1165
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:57,756
switch.

1166
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,166
If one of them controls the

1167
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,036
shade, then it would be better

1168
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:03,446
to separate it out from the

1169
00:37:03,446 --> 00:37:03,826
rest.

1170
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,656
This configuration makes it

1171
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,336
easier for people to remember

1172
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,016
which switch controls the shade,

1173
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:11,956
and which ones control the

1174
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:12,386
lights.

1175
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:15,516
Okay, now it's probably worth

1176
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:17,546
pointing out right now that we

1177
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:19,206
have a very special name for

1178
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:21,066
this configuration, this

1179
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:22,276
arrangement here on the right.

1180
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,076
Does anyone care to guess what

1181
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:24,526
it is?

1182
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:26,116
Just go ahead and shout it out.

1183
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:28,226
Okay, you're smart, you're not

1184
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:28,846
going to fall for it.

1185
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:31,026
I just tried to get you.

1186
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,336
Okay, if you guessed in your

1187
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,036
mind that it is a group, then

1188
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:35,256
you win a prize.

1189
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:36,546
It is a trip to Hawaii.

1190
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,476
Grouping is a very fundamental

1191
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:40,796
and significant design

1192
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:41,376
principle.

1193
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,076
Grouping helps people to

1194
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:44,676
understand the relationships

1195
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:46,656
between elements, and it is key

1196
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:48,306
for giving a design structure.

1197
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,656
Now, while we all understand

1198
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:52,806
this, many apps don't

1199
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:54,196
effectively use grouping.

1200
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,846
It can be easy to overlook.

1201
00:37:57,246 --> 00:37:58,586
Now, let's take a look at a

1202
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,156
couple of examples of how

1203
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,026
proximity and grouping can be

1204
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,636
used to structure a design, and

1205
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:06,546
establish relationships between

1206
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:08,536
controls and the objects or

1207
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,666
views that they affect.

1208
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:13,266
And keynote, proximity helps us

1209
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:16,076
to associate the view menu with

1210
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,006
the slide navigator and the

1211
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:18,706
canvas area.

1212
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,576
The objects that it affects.

1213
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:23,086
The object creation tools are

1214
00:38:23,086 --> 00:38:23,856
positioned right above the

1215
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,476
canvas, which is where those

1216
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:26,646
objects go.

1217
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:29,486
The anime format and document

1218
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:31,456
visibility switches are located

1219
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:32,736
just above where those panels

1220
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:33,436
get displayed.

1221
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,516
In Sketch, you can see how

1222
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,306
grouping is used to cluster

1223
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:39,606
related controls with each

1224
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,416
other, like the grouping

1225
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,016
controls.

1226
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:44,076
The Transform and Edit tools.

1227
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:46,356
The Pathfinding operations.

1228
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:48,646
And the Layer Ordering actions.

1229
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,196
Now, I just shared two Mac apps,

1230
00:38:52,576 --> 00:38:54,206
and the need for proximity and

1231
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,886
grouping is definitely higher

1232
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:57,686
the larger your interface is,

1233
00:38:58,186 --> 00:39:00,086
but the principles are still

1234
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,896
crucial for smaller screens,

1235
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:04,646
like iPads and iPhones, and even

1236
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:05,376
the Apple Watch.

1237
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,546
Okay, so I think there is time

1238
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:10,426
to learn about just one more

1239
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:11,756
design principle before we head

1240
00:39:11,756 --> 00:39:12,986
downstairs to the hotel

1241
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,656
restaurant and grab some dinner.

1242
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:17,016
Let's go back to that Shade

1243
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:17,996
control again.

1244
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,716
Now, looking at this control, do

1245
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:22,406
you suppose that the Shade is

1246
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:24,306
open or closed?

1247
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:25,976
How about now?

1248
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:28,236
Just show of hands here.

1249
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:29,716
How many people think that it is

1250
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:30,286
closed?

1251
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,236
Okay, okay, and how many of you

1252
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:35,356
think that it is open?

1253
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:38,516
Yeah, you guys are a really

1254
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:39,776
smart group of people.

1255
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,816
All right.

1256
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:43,826
Mapping is how you know that it

1257
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:44,336
is closed.

1258
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,376
Mapping is about designing

1259
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:48,556
controls to resemble the objects

1260
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:49,366
that they affect.

1261
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,516
Shades go up, and shades go

1262
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:52,886
down.

1263
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:54,896
So it makes sense to use a

1264
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:56,996
control that mirrors that up and

1265
00:39:56,996 --> 00:39:57,896
down movement.

1266
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:01,126
There is no ambiguity about how

1267
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,976
to raise or lower the shade.

1268
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:05,896
Mapping also relates to how

1269
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:07,706
controls are arranged relative

1270
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:08,356
to each other.

1271
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,526
Their order should resemble the

1272
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,306
configuration of the objects

1273
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:12,966
that they affect.

1274
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,616
So let's say that these light

1275
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,496
switches control three sets of

1276
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:18,856
ceiling lights in the bedroom.

1277
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:21,866
Good mapping involves arranging

1278
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,106
the switches to mirror the

1279
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,746
layout of those lights.

1280
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,076
By focusing on mapping, it is so

1281
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,896
much easier to make choices

1282
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:31,406
about where to position

1283
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,916
controls, how to order them, and

1284
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,816
even which controls to use.

1285
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:37,606
I mean, we've all seen light

1286
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,926
switches that look like this.

1287
00:40:40,316 --> 00:40:41,876
You will often find labels when

1288
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,396
mapping is unclear.

1289
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:44,806
It is a telltale sign.

1290
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:47,116
But it is not a particularly

1291
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:47,976
good solution.

1292
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:49,776
Reading takes time, and it

1293
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:51,106
doesn't help people to memorize

1294
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:53,046
the location of controls or how

1295
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:54,636
they should interact with them.

1296
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:56,566
Now, in the context of

1297
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:57,796
interface, adjusting a

1298
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,356
horizontal property is much more

1299
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,166
intuitive with the horizontal

1300
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:01,626
slider.

1301
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,956
Similarly, using a dial for

1302
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,696
adjusting rotation is much

1303
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,076
better than a slider or a

1304
00:41:07,076 --> 00:41:07,546
stepper.

1305
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:11,046
Of course, the best mapping is

1306
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:12,626
the most direct mapping.

1307
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:14,786
Providing the ability for people

1308
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,666
to directly manipulate an object

1309
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:17,926
is more straightforward, it's

1310
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,416
more intuitive, and precise.

1311
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,026
Whether that is with a pointer

1312
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:24,626
on macOS, or Gestures on iOS.

1313
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:28,086
Okay, so enough about light

1314
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:28,526
switches.

1315
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:30,686
I don't know about you, but I am

1316
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,446
starving, and it is time to head

1317
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,596
downstairs and get some dinner.

1318
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:36,756
Now, we all meet up in the lobby

1319
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:38,076
and we make our way over to the

1320
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:39,956
restaurant, and as you sit down

1321
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,486
at the table, you see in front

1322
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:43,366
of you an empty dinner plate.

1323
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,886
What can you do with this dinner

1324
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:47,126
plate?

1325
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:50,626
Well, of course, you can put

1326
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:53,076
food on it, #putfoodonit

1327
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:54,296
[laughter].

1328
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:56,466
But you can do all sorts of

1329
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:57,546
other stuff too.

1330
00:41:58,476 --> 00:41:59,916
The plate is smooth, so it looks

1331
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,006
like it is easy to rotate and

1332
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:01,676
slide around.

1333
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:04,066
There is a nice little gap along

1334
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,436
the edge, so it looks easy to

1335
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:06,796
grab and lift up.

1336
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:09,256
It looks like a Frisbee, so you

1337
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,546
consider how far you can make it

1338
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:12,596
go.

1339
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:14,006
Or maybe not.

1340
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:16,416
Our notions about how we

1341
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,836
interact with this plate are

1342
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,246
called affordances.

1343
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,186
In other words, a plate's

1344
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:24,966
physical characteristics provide

1345
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:27,876
visual and tactile cues about

1346
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:29,356
what interactions the plate

1347
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:30,626
afford to us.

1348
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:32,576
A plate's physical

1349
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:34,216
characteristics make certain

1350
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:36,016
actions seem possible, and

1351
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:37,286
others less possible.

1352
00:42:37,976 --> 00:42:38,896
We look at the plate, and we

1353
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:39,916
think, I am going to put food

1354
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:40,886
onto this object.

1355
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:42,896
Or, we might also think, I'm

1356
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,256
going to use this object to

1357
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:45,836
transport my food to a different

1358
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:46,356
location.

1359
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:48,226
We don't look at this plate and

1360
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:49,536
think, I'm going to use it for

1361
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:50,386
drinking water.

1362
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,366
Affordance is not an attribute

1363
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:54,646
of the object itself.

1364
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:56,856
It is more about the

1365
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:58,726
relationship that individuals

1366
00:42:58,866 --> 00:42:59,946
have to an object.

1367
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:03,806
Affordance varies based on one's

1368
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:05,186
physical abilities.

1369
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,246
So, therefore, affordance varies

1370
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:08,436
from person to person.

1371
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:10,636
So, for example, this is kind of

1372
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:11,356
an extreme one.

1373
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:13,846
A Frisbee affords me with a

1374
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:15,486
possibility of catching and

1375
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:15,976
throwing.

1376
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,356
For my dog, a Frisbee affords

1377
00:43:18,356 --> 00:43:20,276
the ability of catching, but not

1378
00:43:20,276 --> 00:43:20,706
throwing.

1379
00:43:21,286 --> 00:43:23,556
A plate affords me with the

1380
00:43:23,556 --> 00:43:25,466
ability of eating food off of

1381
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:26,253
it.

1382
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:28,226
Interestingly, my dog perceives

1383
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,386
the very same affordance.

1384
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,446
Now, because affordance is

1385
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,476
subjective, one person can

1386
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:35,566
perceive an affordance when

1387
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:36,386
another does not.

1388
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:38,126
People are more likely to

1389
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:39,206
perceive an affordance when it

1390
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:40,776
is related to an action that

1391
00:43:40,776 --> 00:43:42,126
they are more likely to take.

1392
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,516
So, for instance, I could use a

1393
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:47,256
plate as a saucer, and it would

1394
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:48,696
make a really great saucer.

1395
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:50,236
I don't think I would get any

1396
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:53,386
argument from you guys, but this

1397
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:55,116
is an unlikely action to take,

1398
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,876
so I wouldn't readily perceive a

1399
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,326
plate's glass-putting

1400
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:00,566
affordance, whereas I'm very

1401
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,766
likely to put food on it.

1402
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:03,786
So I readily perceive the

1403
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,336
plate's food-putting affordance.

1404
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:08,736
You perceive affordances with

1405
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:10,266
every environment and every

1406
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:11,596
object that you have ever

1407
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:12,426
interacted with.

1408
00:44:13,076 --> 00:44:14,166
When you walked into the

1409
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,276
restaurant, you passed through a

1410
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:17,566
door that afforded you the

1411
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:18,916
ability of passage.

1412
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:21,096
The door is human-sized, so you

1413
00:44:21,096 --> 00:44:22,766
can imagine your body moving

1414
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:24,036
through it unobstructed.

1415
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:26,226
There was a continuous grounds

1416
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:27,746
plane, so you can imagine

1417
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:29,056
yourself walking along it,

1418
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:30,526
without stumbling, tripping.

1419
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:32,966
The chair that you sat in

1420
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:34,886
affords the ability for sitting.

1421
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,136
The table in front of you

1422
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:38,616
affords the ability of putting

1423
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:39,696
objects onto it.

1424
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,286
The ground below your feet

1425
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:44,176
affords the ability for resting

1426
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:44,556
your feet.

1427
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:47,896
Manufactured objects include

1428
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,976
cues to evoke affordances.

1429
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:52,256
They let people know what

1430
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,866
actions are possible, and the

1431
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,996
obviousness and visibility of

1432
00:44:56,996 --> 00:44:58,526
those cues helps people to know

1433
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:00,846
the correct or the intended ways

1434
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,846
of interacting, and the same

1435
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:04,096
should be true for apps.

1436
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,106
Sliders afford dragging a knob

1437
00:45:07,176 --> 00:45:08,436
along a track.

1438
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:10,676
Dials afford rotating.

1439
00:45:11,396 --> 00:45:13,546
Buttons afford tapping, and

1440
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:13,916
clicking.

1441
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,406
In each of these examples,

1442
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:18,326
affordance is communicated with

1443
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:19,766
maximum efficiency.

1444
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:22,236
In fact, over time, we are all

1445
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,726
becoming more comfortable with

1446
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:25,096
increasing levels of

1447
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:25,926
abstraction.

1448
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:28,186
The button, after all, is just a

1449
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:30,386
highly abstracted version of a

1450
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:32,586
physical, real-world button.

1451
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,456
All that's necessary to create a

1452
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:36,756
strong connection between the

1453
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:38,176
two are the rounding of the

1454
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:38,816
corners.

1455
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,006
A subtle drop shadow around the

1456
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,596
slider knob separates it from

1457
00:45:42,596 --> 00:45:43,726
the track that it is positioned

1458
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:45,336
over, and this separation

1459
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:46,676
suggests that it can be moved

1460
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:47,506
independently.

1461
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,576
And even that visual cue might

1462
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:51,316
not be completely necessary.

1463
00:45:51,746 --> 00:45:53,176
For most people, simply seeing a

1464
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:54,686
filled-in circle over a line is

1465
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,566
all that is needed to express a

1466
00:45:56,566 --> 00:45:57,676
sliding affordance.

1467
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,236
And sometimes affordance is

1468
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:01,886
communicated using animation.

1469
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:03,956
Tapping on the Weather app, we

1470
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:05,966
see it slide up a little bit.

1471
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:07,456
This suggests the possibility

1472
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:09,186
that the content areas can be

1473
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:09,736
scrolled.

1474
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:14,506
And sure enough, they can.

1475
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,066
Regardless of the exact

1476
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,496
technique that you use, your

1477
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:19,426
app's interface must make clear

1478
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,136
what action possibilities it

1479
00:46:21,136 --> 00:46:21,636
affords.

1480
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,196
If not, people won't know how to

1481
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:25,516
properly interact with it.

1482
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:27,006
They'll interact in ways that

1483
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:28,356
your app doesn't support, and

1484
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:30,046
they'll confuse controls for

1485
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:31,616
non-interactive objects.

1486
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:35,106
Okay. So, now that we know where

1487
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:37,086
our food is supposed to go, it

1488
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:37,956
is time to order.

1489
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:39,866
Now, I am thinking about getting

1490
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,466
a cheeseburger because they're

1491
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,266
delicious, obviously, and when a

1492
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:45,966
waiter comes by to take my

1493
00:46:45,966 --> 00:46:47,856
order, I say, "Cheeseburger,

1494
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:48,196
please."

1495
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:51,066
He then asks how I would like it

1496
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:52,566
cooked, and "medium," I say.

1497
00:46:53,356 --> 00:46:54,236
He then asks what kind of

1498
00:46:54,236 --> 00:46:55,646
cheese, cheddar, Swiss, Jack,

1499
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,586
Gruyere, cottage?

1500
00:46:57,246 --> 00:46:58,456
"Cheddar," I say.

1501
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,656
He then asks whether I would

1502
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:03,116
like bacon, egg, avocado on it?

1503
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:04,826
"None," I say.

1504
00:47:05,016 --> 00:47:06,686
I am trying to keep my figure.

1505
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:09,406
He then asks whether I'd like

1506
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:11,346
salad, fries or onion rings.

1507
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,236
"Onion rings," I say.

1508
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:15,506
He then asks if I realize that

1509
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:16,746
cheeseburgers and onion rings

1510
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,896
are very high in calories, to

1511
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:20,656
which I reply, "Fake news"

1512
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:21,816
[laughter].

1513
00:47:21,816 --> 00:47:32,646
This [applause] in a nutshell is

1514
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,206
the principle of progressive

1515
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:34,836
disclosure.

1516
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:37,036
Progressive disclosure is a

1517
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:38,526
technique for managing

1518
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:39,226
complexity.

1519
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:41,546
The term is used almost

1520
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:43,286
exclusively in the context of

1521
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:45,066
interaction design, and to my

1522
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:46,196
knowledge, this is the first

1523
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,236
time that anyone was dumb enough

1524
00:47:48,236 --> 00:47:49,346
to try to use it to describe

1525
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:50,336
ordering a cheeseburger.

1526
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:52,926
The basic idea is this.

1527
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:55,716
Progressive disclosure gradually

1528
00:47:55,716 --> 00:47:57,666
eases people from the simple to

1529
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,756
the more complex.

1530
00:47:59,856 --> 00:48:01,546
And progressive disclosure is

1531
00:48:01,636 --> 00:48:03,276
also about hiding away

1532
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:05,116
complexity, so that people can

1533
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,026
accomplish basic tasks with

1534
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:09,176
simple and more approachable

1535
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:09,966
interfaces.

1536
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:12,406
Ordering a cheeseburger would be

1537
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:14,656
way more complex and daunting if

1538
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:15,886
you had to consider all of those

1539
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:16,816
options at once.

1540
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:18,856
Customizing your cheeseburger is

1541
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,396
way easier when someone steps

1542
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,196
you through the process one

1543
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:23,306
decision at a time.

1544
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:25,506
And some choices that you make

1545
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:27,296
early on could make other

1546
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:28,816
choices irrelevant later.

1547
00:48:29,496 --> 00:48:31,776
So, for example, if I'd asked

1548
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:33,576
for French fries, the waiter

1549
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:35,116
would have then asked whether I

1550
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:37,276
wanted regular, truffle or

1551
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,136
garlic fries, and because I

1552
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:40,906
didn't ask for fries, I don't

1553
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:42,596
really care what kind of French

1554
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:44,736
fries they have, and telling me

1555
00:48:44,736 --> 00:48:46,466
about those options would just

1556
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,176
be a waste of my time and my

1557
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,646
limited mental abilities.

1558
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:52,976
Or would it be?

1559
00:48:53,856 --> 00:48:55,786
I mean, I like garlic fries a

1560
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:58,116
lot, and had I known that garlic

1561
00:48:58,116 --> 00:48:59,936
fries were on offer, I would

1562
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:00,666
have gotten them.

1563
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:04,086
So herein lies the rub.

1564
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:06,926
Progressive disclosure is a

1565
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:08,726
necessary and helpful technique

1566
00:49:09,036 --> 00:49:11,346
for managing complexity and

1567
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:12,906
simplifying decision making.

1568
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:15,966
But the same technique can bury

1569
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:17,596
information or functionality.

1570
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:19,436
So what do you do?

1571
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:22,126
Well, discussions about how to

1572
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,276
properly use progressive

1573
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:24,866
disclosure often come down to

1574
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:25,776
the 80/20 rule.

1575
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:27,556
If you're not familiar, the

1576
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:29,696
80/20 rule is a design principle

1577
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:33,076
that says in essence 80 percent

1578
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:35,236
of a system's effects come from

1579
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:37,396
20 percent of its causes.

1580
00:49:38,506 --> 00:49:40,166
For an app, this might mean that

1581
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,606
80 percent of its benefit comes

1582
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,586
from 20 percent of the actions

1583
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:47,166
that it presents, or 80 percent

1584
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,876
of the people who use an app are

1585
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:51,346
only going to use 20 percent of

1586
00:49:51,346 --> 00:49:52,126
its functions.

1587
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:55,026
Now, the exact percentages are,

1588
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,026
of course, different.

1589
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,086
But the basic point is valid.

1590
00:49:58,596 --> 00:49:59,956
Not all information or

1591
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,016
functionality are created equal.

1592
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:04,566
Some is much more important than

1593
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:05,066
others.

1594
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,756
So, in order to reduce clutter,

1595
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:10,656
and simplify decision-making, it

1596
00:50:10,656 --> 00:50:12,256
is a really good thing to use

1597
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:14,336
progressive disclosure to hide

1598
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:15,826
things of lesser importance.

1599
00:50:16,946 --> 00:50:18,546
In other words, if your app is

1600
00:50:18,546 --> 00:50:21,036
complex, it is okay to make the

1601
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:22,756
most useful 20 percent of

1602
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:25,186
functions easier to find by

1603
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:27,056
hiding the other 80 percent.

1604
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:29,946
A classic example of this is the

1605
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:30,736
print dialogue.

1606
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:33,106
Most of the time, people only

1607
00:50:33,106 --> 00:50:35,146
care about the basics, which

1608
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:36,586
printer they're printing to, how

1609
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:38,186
many copies, what the range of

1610
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:39,016
pages are.

1611
00:50:39,806 --> 00:50:41,916
These are way less than 20

1612
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:42,916
percent of the functions

1613
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,836
available, and it is what people

1614
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:47,096
want way more than 80 percent of

1615
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:47,546
the time.

1616
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:50,306
When more control is needed, a

1617
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:51,936
bunch of options are just one

1618
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:52,486
click away.

1619
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:55,036
Not only does progressive

1620
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:56,686
disclosure reduce visual

1621
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,866
clutter, and make printing less

1622
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:01,296
difficult, it also lowers the

1623
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:02,556
likelihood of people getting

1624
00:51:02,556 --> 00:51:04,746
confused and changing a setting

1625
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:05,476
that they don't really

1626
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:06,196
understand.

1627
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:08,706
Most of us have experienced

1628
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:10,426
receiving this call from a

1629
00:51:10,426 --> 00:51:12,076
parent, or a family member, or a

1630
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:14,316
friend, who is kind of freaking

1631
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:15,926
out because their computer is

1632
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:17,556
not working properly, and they

1633
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:18,616
changed something, and they

1634
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:19,776
don't really know what they did.

1635
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:22,646
This is why progressive

1636
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,906
disclosure is your best friend.

1637
00:51:25,856 --> 00:51:27,386
By keeping things simple for

1638
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,776
novices, they are less likely to

1639
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:31,756
feel intimidated, overwhelmed,

1640
00:51:32,106 --> 00:51:33,466
or get themselves into trouble,

1641
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,426
while more experienced users can

1642
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,216
quickly reveal the options and

1643
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:39,516
actions that they require, that

1644
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:41,216
they understand, and that they

1645
00:51:41,216 --> 00:51:42,506
are capable of using.

1646
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:47,396
Okay. Anyhow, in case you were

1647
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,106
wondering, the cheeseburger and

1648
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,546
onion rings were delicious,

1649
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:52,256
thank you very much for asking.

1650
00:51:53,336 --> 00:51:55,686
Okay, so it is time for us to

1651
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:56,406
get some sleep.

1652
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,046
We will be getting up early

1653
00:51:58,046 --> 00:51:59,136
tomorrow, and we are going to be

1654
00:51:59,136 --> 00:52:01,486
doing some snorkeling, so guys,

1655
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:01,906
rest up.

1656
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,796
Okay, did everyone sleep well?

1657
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:06,896
Was your room comfortable?

1658
00:52:06,896 --> 00:52:08,126
Were you able to turn on your

1659
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,306
lights successfully?

1660
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:11,086
How is that Morty faucet?

1661
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,406
That was pretty weird, right?

1662
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,206
Okay, enough small talk.

1663
00:52:14,206 --> 00:52:15,866
It is time for us to go see some

1664
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,296
fish.

1665
00:52:16,796 --> 00:52:18,116
Now, after another highly

1666
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:20,036
successful car ride, we get to

1667
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,806
the beach, and you put on your

1668
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:22,856
goggles, and you put on your

1669
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,616
flippers, you adjust your

1670
00:52:24,616 --> 00:52:26,696
snorkel just so, and you get

1671
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:27,786
into the water.

1672
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,526
Now, there are some tropical

1673
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:30,236
fish.

1674
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:32,566
There is a blowfish.

1675
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:35,096
There is a school of tuna fish.

1676
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,396
There is a giant squid, for some

1677
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:40,606
reason, because I had the emoji

1678
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:41,796
[laughter].

1679
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:44,756
It is a magical underwater

1680
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:45,486
wonderland.

1681
00:52:46,516 --> 00:52:49,666
It is so utterly beautiful, but

1682
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,096
why?

1683
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:53,466
This brings us to our very last

1684
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:54,386
design principle.

1685
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:58,046
Symmetry. Symmetry is a concept

1686
00:52:58,046 --> 00:52:59,526
that we are all deeply familiar

1687
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:01,256
with, and when we think about

1688
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:02,566
symmetry, we typically think

1689
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:04,756
about reflectional or bilateral

1690
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:05,296
symmetry.

1691
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:06,926
But there is more.

1692
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:09,436
There is also radial, and

1693
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,626
rotational symmetry.

1694
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:13,546
And there is also translational

1695
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:14,106
symmetry.

1696
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:17,936
These three types of symmetry

1697
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:19,656
are ubiquitous in nature.

1698
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:21,896
Symmetrical forms are efficient

1699
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,826
forms, and we tend to associate

1700
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,186
them with good health, with

1701
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:27,026
stability, balance, and

1702
00:53:27,026 --> 00:53:27,846
orderliness.

1703
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,966
And we consider them to be

1704
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:32,136
aesthetically pleasing, probably

1705
00:53:32,136 --> 00:53:33,636
for very good evolutionary

1706
00:53:33,636 --> 00:53:34,286
reasons.

1707
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:37,016
Symmetrical elements, even if

1708
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:38,146
they are not physically

1709
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:39,876
connected to each other, are

1710
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:41,726
perceived as though they are.

1711
00:53:42,506 --> 00:53:44,776
So when we see these two facing

1712
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:46,996
square brackets, our mind

1713
00:53:46,996 --> 00:53:48,796
unconsciously integrates them

1714
00:53:49,186 --> 00:53:51,696
into one coherent object.

1715
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:54,526
And as you swim around, you'll

1716
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,176
find all three forms of

1717
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:56,746
symmetry.

1718
00:53:57,906 --> 00:54:00,986
Bilateral symmetry, rotational

1719
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:03,676
symmetry, and translational

1720
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:04,146
symmetry.

1721
00:54:05,236 --> 00:54:07,026
As a matter of fact, just about

1722
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:08,526
every type of plant or animal,

1723
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:11,166
both in the sea, in the water,

1724
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,776
on land, in the air,

1725
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:14,936
demonstrates one or more types

1726
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:15,696
of symmetry.

1727
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:18,216
And most human-made objects do

1728
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:18,746
as well.

1729
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:21,396
Light switches are symmetrical

1730
00:54:21,396 --> 00:54:23,426
across both the horizontal and

1731
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,326
vertical axes.

1732
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:26,996
Faucets are symmetrical.

1733
00:54:27,756 --> 00:54:29,506
And cars are symmetrical.

1734
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:31,636
[Laughs] Now there is obviously

1735
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:34,406
some very practical functional

1736
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:36,626
reasons why cars are

1737
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:37,336
symmetrical.

1738
00:54:37,996 --> 00:54:40,846
I mean, there is a very rational

1739
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:42,126
reason why you don't want to get

1740
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:44,066
into that car.

1741
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:47,386
But there are clearly aesthetic

1742
00:54:47,386 --> 00:54:48,326
benefits as well.

1743
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:51,036
Attractive interfaces tend to

1744
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:52,446
demonstrate a mixture of

1745
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:54,236
reflectional and translational

1746
00:54:54,236 --> 00:54:54,786
symmetry.

1747
00:54:55,246 --> 00:54:56,716
In the Weather app, reflectional

1748
00:54:56,716 --> 00:54:58,106
symmetry provides a sense of

1749
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:58,716
balance.

1750
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:01,116
Key elements are centered along

1751
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:03,526
a median line, while almost all

1752
00:55:03,526 --> 00:55:04,526
of the other elements are

1753
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:05,856
counter-balanced with each

1754
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:06,116
other.

1755
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:08,306
This is a pattern which is

1756
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,216
reflected in apps like the

1757
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:14,246
Camera app, the Clock app, and

1758
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:16,496
the Phone app, and many, many

1759
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:16,816
more.

1760
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:20,276
Translational symmetry gives an

1761
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,136
interface a sense of structure,

1762
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:24,166
and order through the repetition

1763
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,356
of like elements.

1764
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:27,486
You can see translational

1765
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:29,366
symmetry in the even repetition

1766
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:31,126
of cities and times in the Clock

1767
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,876
app, or the even cadence of

1768
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:35,346
locations in the Weather app.

1769
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:37,676
When laying out your app's

1770
00:55:37,676 --> 00:55:39,146
interface, look for

1771
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:41,586
opportunities to use symmetry to

1772
00:55:41,586 --> 00:55:43,206
provide a sense of balance and

1773
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:43,556
order.

1774
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:47,536
Okay, so, everyone, I am sorry

1775
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:48,736
to be the bearer of bad news,

1776
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,786
but it's time for us to get out

1777
00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:51,306
of the water.

1778
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,706
There are a lot of you, and we

1779
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:53,816
can only pay for a half day

1780
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:54,076
trip.

1781
00:55:54,746 --> 00:55:56,206
Also, I don't know if you saw,

1782
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:57,496
there was a shark in the water,

1783
00:55:57,496 --> 00:55:58,626
and I am really starting to

1784
00:55:58,626 --> 00:55:59,086
freak out.

1785
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:03,496
So we return back to sunny San

1786
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:03,936
Jose.

1787
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:06,186
Now, the snorkeling here is not

1788
00:56:06,186 --> 00:56:07,606
quite as beautiful as Hawaii,

1789
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:09,506
and I strongly urge you not to

1790
00:56:09,506 --> 00:56:10,246
go into the bay.

1791
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:12,096
But our technical and design

1792
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,516
content is way better, so it's a

1793
00:56:14,516 --> 00:56:14,966
win-win.

1794
00:56:15,846 --> 00:56:17,226
Now, the design principles that

1795
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:18,836
we explored today express

1796
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:21,126
fundamental truths about human

1797
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,616
perception and cognition.

1798
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:25,466
They are simple, but powerful

1799
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,536
reminders about the true nature

1800
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:29,376
and purpose of design.

1801
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:31,806
They provide a framework for

1802
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,796
understanding, and a language

1803
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:36,136
for articulating a design's

1804
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,486
strengths and its shortcomings.

1805
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,336
My hope is that in sharing these

1806
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:42,806
principles with you today, you

1807
00:56:43,746 --> 00:56:45,496
will come away with a clear

1808
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:48,256
sense of how your app's designs

1809
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:50,966
can help to fulfill those basic

1810
00:56:50,966 --> 00:56:53,066
needs that we all share.

1811
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,356
The need to feel safe.

1812
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:57,256
The need to understand.

1813
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:59,376
The need to achieve our goals,

1814
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:01,306
and the need to experience

1815
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:02,946
beauty and joy.

1816
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:05,826
Now, to be sure, while these

1817
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,146
principles are, in many ways,

1818
00:57:07,146 --> 00:57:08,566
quite simple, applying them to

1819
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:09,926
your work is not.

1820
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:12,486
Each of these principles could

1821
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:13,686
lead you into different

1822
00:57:13,686 --> 00:57:15,486
directions about what you should

1823
00:57:15,486 --> 00:57:17,066
do with the design of your app.

1824
00:57:18,116 --> 00:57:20,196
Designing is so often about

1825
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:21,776
resolving those differences.

1826
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,896
This is something that the very

1827
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:25,526
best designers struggle with.

1828
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:28,676
It is also possible to have too

1829
00:57:28,676 --> 00:57:29,566
much of a good thing.

1830
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,376
Too much feedback is annoying.

1831
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:32,896
Too much visibility is

1832
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:33,556
distracting.

1833
00:57:33,836 --> 00:57:35,486
Too much progressive disclosure

1834
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,596
can make work flows inefficient.

1835
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:39,866
So you have to be measured in

1836
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:41,846
your approach, and exercise

1837
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:43,646
judgment and discretion.

1838
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:46,006
And the relevance of each

1839
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:48,096
principle can vary depending on

1840
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:49,596
what kind of app you're making.

1841
00:57:50,606 --> 00:57:52,376
Platform. Screen size.

1842
00:57:52,776 --> 00:57:55,556
Use case. The experience level

1843
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:56,356
of the people who you are

1844
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:57,256
designing for.

1845
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,816
These factors and more should

1846
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:01,736
influence what principles are

1847
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:03,616
most relevant at any given

1848
00:58:03,616 --> 00:58:03,986
moment.

1849
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:06,636
Working through this can be

1850
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:07,266
challenging.

1851
00:58:07,996 --> 00:58:09,276
No one said that designing is

1852
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:11,966
easy, but I do not want you to

1853
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:12,986
be discouraged.

1854
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:15,576
Designing is a lot easier when

1855
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,926
you understand the fundamentals.

1856
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,456
Let these principles be your

1857
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,416
North Star.

1858
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:23,386
They will guide you toward

1859
00:58:23,386 --> 00:58:25,946
making apps that better serve

1860
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:27,996
the human beings that you are

1861
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:28,876
designing for.

1862
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:31,396
And that is the thing that

1863
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:32,366
matters most.

1864
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,406
And in turn, the people that you

1865
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:36,516
are designing for will

1866
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:39,366
recognize, on some level, all of

1867
00:58:39,366 --> 00:58:40,846
the hard work that you have

1868
00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:41,456
invested.

1869
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:43,306
They will appreciate the

1870
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:46,236
thoughtfulness and care, and

1871
00:58:46,586 --> 00:58:49,216
they will sense the humanity of

1872
00:58:49,336 --> 00:58:51,526
the people who made it.

1873
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:55,186
Okay, so for more information,

1874
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:56,256
check out this URL.

1875
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:58,966
And, I want to highlight how

1876
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,656
many amazing design sessions we

1877
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:01,416
have for you this week.

1878
00:59:01,826 --> 00:59:03,946
We actually have eight design

1879
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:06,246
sessions, which is more than we

1880
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:07,186
have ever done before.

1881
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:08,556
We have three sessions that have

1882
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,986
five mini sessions in them each.

1883
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:12,256
There is a lot of fantastic

1884
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:12,736
content.

1885
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:14,466
In particular, I want to

1886
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,286
highlight a couple of sessions.

1887
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:18,426
One is called Designing Sound.

1888
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:21,216
It is being given by the person

1889
00:59:21,216 --> 00:59:22,736
who makes basically all the

1890
00:59:22,736 --> 00:59:24,286
sounds that are on your devices.

1891
00:59:24,596 --> 00:59:26,376
It is nothing, like nothing we

1892
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:27,256
have ever done before.

1893
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:28,556
It is really fantastic.

1894
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:29,496
It is this afternoon.

1895
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,656
And you should go check out

1896
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:33,546
tomorrow, a presentation called

1897
00:59:33,546 --> 00:59:35,076
Designing Across Platforms,

1898
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:37,266
which helps to solve really

1899
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:39,266
tricky issues about how to adapt

1900
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:41,096
