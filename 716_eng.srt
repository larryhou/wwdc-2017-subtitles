1
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:26,116
Hello to everybody who's still

2
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:26,436
here.

3
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,756
I'm Steve Hayman.

4
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:30,926
I'm a consulting engineer from

5
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:31,726
Toronto, Canada.

6
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:32,496
Any Canadians here?

7
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,456
Good. How's it going, eh?

8
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:36,496
I'd like to say hello to those

9
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:37,906
of you who are still here late

10
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:38,936
on Friday afternoon.

11
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:41,076
And to everyone who's watching

12
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:43,126
the video in the future, hello

13
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,656
people in the future with the

14
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,186
flying cars and everything.

15
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,506
I'm very excited to see what

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,536
that turns out to be.

17
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:50,646
But today we have the thrilling

18
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:52,986
topic of iOS Configuration and

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,516
APIs for Kiosk and Assessment

20
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:55,826
Apps.

21
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:58,346
What are we talking about?

22
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,316
We're talking about locking an

23
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,696
iPad to a single application.

24
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:04,066
We're going to talk about

25
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,756
different ways that you might do

26
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:05,926
that.

27
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:07,016
Some of them are manual

28
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:07,776
processes.

29
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,136
Some of them are programmatic.

30
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:10,486
But let me show you a couple of

31
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:13,326
examples of what we're talking

32
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:15,016
about right now.

33
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:20,446
So here's my iPad.

34
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,476
Here's one thing you can do.

35
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:25,506
Anybody can do this on any iPad.

36
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,946
Anybody can go to Settings,

37
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,996
General, Accessibility, way down

38
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,436
at bottom, Guided Access.

39
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,756
And if you turn this on, it is

40
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:36,726
now possible to lock an iPad,

41
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,726
any iPad, to any arbitrary

42
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:39,676
application.

43
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:41,566
A lot of parents and teachers do

44
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:42,766
this before they turn over their

45
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:43,816
iPad to their child.

46
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,446
For instance, if your child was

47
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:47,296
very interested in maps, you

48
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,336
could launch Maps, and then

49
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,546
since Guided Access is on, you

50
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:51,696
can triple tap, one, two, three

51
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,036
times, on the Home button, and

52
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:56,406
supply a pass code.

53
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:59,046
A very secret pass code.

54
00:01:59,156 --> 00:01:59,676
No guessing.

55
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:00,476
[sound effects].

56
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:04,976
And now I can hand the iPad to

57
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,106
my geography-obsessed child, and

58
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,145
they can play with Maps all day

59
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:09,406
long, but they can't touch the

60
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:09,846
Home button.

61
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,216
They can't get out and start

62
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:14,006
messing with my stuff, until I

63
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:15,076
triple tap the Home button

64
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:17,136
again, one, two, three, and put

65
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,986
in the pass code.

66
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,166
So this is Guided Access.

67
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,746
This is an accessibility

68
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:23,926
technology from Apple that's

69
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,046
been around for a long time.

70
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:27,546
It's a basic way to lock an iPad

71
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:29,326
to any application that you

72
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:29,596
want.

73
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:30,696
That's one way, but I want to

74
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,286
show you another way.

75
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,076
We're all developers.

76
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:33,206
Let's talk about a programmatic

77
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,346
way to do this.

78
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:38,516
I have a testing application on

79
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,636
here that you might see in a

80
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:41,686
school for administering

81
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:42,466
standardized tests.

82
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,906
And in schools, we are a little

83
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:46,496
bit concerned about letting

84
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:47,816
students touch the Home button,

85
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:49,216
and fire up Safari, and go to

86
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,296
Wikipedia during the test.

87
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,016
We don't really want that

88
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:51,576
happening.

89
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,586
So an application like this one,

90
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:55,196
when I tap Start Test, we're not

91
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,076
locked right at the moment.

92
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,046
I can still hit the Home button.

93
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,456
But once I touch Start Test,

94
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,186
this particular app is set up to

95
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,046
lock iOS on demand, at the

96
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,226
moment I touch that button.

97
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,176
You get a little panel here that

98
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,316
says, "Do you want to confirm

99
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:08,296
app self lock?"

100
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:11,046
And if I say yes, the test

101
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:11,586
begins.

102
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:13,736
The Home button is now locked.

103
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,236
It was locked by some code that

104
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,656
I'll show you at exactly this

105
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:16,926
point.

106
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,466
And I can't cheat in the test.

107
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,396
I can't hit the Home button to

108
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:21,736
get out.

109
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,566
I can submit my answer here,

110
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:25,536
Ottawa.

111
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:26,916
And at the moment I hit Submit,

112
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,876
this particular app unlocks iOS.

113
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:31,686
So there's a function we're

114
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:32,396
going to tell you about that

115
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:33,586
turns the locking on and off.

116
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:35,366
So now I'm back to a point where

117
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:36,326
I can hit the Home button.

118
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,456
So those are two different

119
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,056
approaches.

120
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:42,796
One of them a fairly manual

121
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,326
approach, Guided Access, walking

122
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:45,416
around and actually triple

123
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,276
tapping on a device.

124
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:46,966
And then the other one is a

125
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,116
programmatic approach, which I

126
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,316
think you would agree is a

127
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,146
little more flexible.

128
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,456
Those are two ways.

129
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,356
I'm going to talk about four

130
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,836
ways that you might lock an

131
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:55,356
application.

132
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,696
One that we just saw was Guided

133
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,136
Access.

134
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,526
This is a great technology for

135
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:01,676
keeping a child, for instance,

136
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,476
focused on a certain task.

137
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,866
You can lock your child into

138
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,336
Swift Playgrounds and not let

139
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,616
them out until they can explain

140
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,156
the difference between a struct

141
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,516
and a class, for instance.

142
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,486
Whatever scenario you want, you

143
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,936
can lock a child to a particular

144
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:15,846
application.

145
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:18,176
There's another technology

146
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,846
you'll often see in Kiosks,

147
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:20,805
single app mode.

148
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:22,336
This is useful to keep the iPad

149
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,596
pretty much permanently locked

150
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:25,706
to a particular application.

151
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,426
You've probably seen this if

152
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:28,556
you've gone to an Apple store.

153
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:29,886
There's some iPads on display

154
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,296
that are permanently running an

155
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,746
information application, and you

156
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:33,716
can't get out.

157
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:35,936
But there are two techniques

158
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:37,186
available to programmers.

159
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:38,616
The first is called autonomous

160
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,016
single app mode.

161
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:42,296
Picture a situation where you

162
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,656
have a medical clinic, and the

163
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:46,066
nurse is using an application

164
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,536
with confidential information on

165
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:49,116
it, and then a patient arrives.

166
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,416
You'd like to hand them the iPad

167
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,166
to check in and have it locked

168
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:53,636
during that little transaction

169
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:55,146
and have it unlocked when you

170
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,416
get it back so that they can't

171
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,296
hit the Home button and mess

172
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,766
around during one section of

173
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,366
your application.

174
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,726
That's called autonomous single

175
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:02,186
app mode.

176
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,446
It's a single app mode where

177
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,856
locking takes place, but it's

178
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:05,986
autonomous, because it's your

179
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,286
application that decides when

180
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:08,336
the right time is.

181
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,176
And there's a fourth mode

182
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,866
specifically designed for the

183
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,306
education community for people

184
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,476
building standardized test

185
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:15,806
applications, automatic

186
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:16,816
assessment configuration.

187
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,986
This is for students taking a

188
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,446
high stakes test, and it locks

189
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,356
the iPad, but it also disables

190
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,036
some additional features, like

191
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,356
spellchecking, and auto correct,

192
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:28,166
and Siri that you would not want

193
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,276
a student to be using on a test.

194
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,176
We're going to talk about these

195
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:31,396
four scenarios.

196
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:32,586
They each have different

197
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,276
technical requirements.

198
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,236
Guided Access really just works

199
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,456
on any iPad at all.

200
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,776
Anybody can walk up, and turn it

201
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:40,506
on, and triple tap to enable it.

202
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,876
It's a very widely available

203
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:42,926
technology.

204
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:44,776
Single app mode that you would

205
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:45,976
see with Kiosks, this is

206
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,506
something that only works on a

207
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,626
managed and supervised device.

208
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:51,966
So it won't work on the

209
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,326
run-of-the-mill, bring your own

210
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,086
iPad from home.

211
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,396
It works only on a managed

212
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,456
device, and it requires support

213
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:00,356
from MDM and from the system

214
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,016
administrator.

215
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:02,436
Somebody has to designate

216
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,436
exactly which apps, exactly

217
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,616
which single app, we're going to

218
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,636
lock right now.

219
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:09,526
Autonomous single app mode, much

220
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:10,186
more flexible.

221
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,526
It still requires supervised

222
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,336
devices, and it requires the

223
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,376
administrator to white list

224
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,216
specific applications, but now

225
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,346
it means that the iPad can

226
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:20,766
decide.

227
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:22,276
Your app can decide when to turn

228
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:23,916
the locking on and when to turn

229
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,536
it off.

230
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:26,366
And finally, the last one,

231
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,166
automatic assessment

232
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,506
configuration, is the best for

233
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,756
assessment developers because it

234
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,666
locks the iPad and it also

235
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,756
disables a whole variety of

236
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:35,226
features that creative students

237
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,286
might use to enhance their ways

238
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:40,486
to answer questions on a test.

239
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:41,586
That automatic assessment

240
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,336
configuration requires a special

241
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,776
entitlement that you can apply

242
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:45,866
from Apple, but once you've got

243
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,676
that entitlement, your app can

244
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,996
lock any device, whether it's

245
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:52,086
managed or not.

246
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,596
So locking an iPad

247
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:54,246
programmatically.

248
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:55,696
Several different ways.

249
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,236
Guided access, we saw a moment

250
00:06:58,236 --> 00:06:59,576
ago, is a great way to focus a

251
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,976
child on a particular task, and

252
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:04,176
it has some obvious advantages.

253
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:05,196
Anybody can set it up.

254
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:06,556
It's very easy to set up.

255
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,336
And a couple of concerns.

256
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,556
It's not a particularly scalable

257
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:12,856
way to do anything, because you

258
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:14,066
have to walk around and actually

259
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,646
touch every iPad.

260
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:17,156
If you have hundreds of students

261
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:18,676
who are about to take a test,

262
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,826
someone would have to walk

263
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:20,976
around and touch the Home button

264
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:22,326
three times on each of the 100

265
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:22,836
devices.

266
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,346
That doesn't scale very well,

267
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:26,136
plus you have to manage a pass

268
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:26,356
code.

269
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,406
So it's great for some

270
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,906
situations, but not others.

271
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:31,446
Single app mode that you might

272
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,406
do with a kiosk brings a level

273
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:34,926
of remote control to this

274
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:35,716
process.

275
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,226
If you have iPads where there's

276
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:38,546
only one application that you

277
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:40,546
might ever want to run, maybe

278
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:41,726
something that displays train

279
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,336
schedules or conference room

280
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,866
reservations, an admin can push

281
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,196
a command to a managed iPad to

282
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:49,976
lock it right now to that

283
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:50,506
application.

284
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:51,696
In fact, you can lock hundreds

285
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,386
or thousands of applications of

286
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:54,966
iPads simultaneously.

287
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:57,986
Here's what it might look like.

288
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,396
Let's suppose you have some sort

289
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,026
of a tourism kiosk, and you want

290
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,356
your iPad to run this

291
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,976
application only.

292
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:08,156
An administrator using an MDM

293
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:12,376
tool, which specify that your

294
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,636
application is the one that's

295
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:15,796
allowed to do single app mode,

296
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:16,886
and then the moment they push

297
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,406
this configuration out, the iPad

298
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,536
immediately launches that app,

299
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,216
and it stays in that app.

300
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:22,736
If you reboot the device, it

301
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,186
goes back to the kiosk

302
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:24,936
application again.

303
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:25,956
This is a good way to pretty

304
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:28,186
much permanently lock an iPad to

305
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:29,126
a particular application.

306
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,596
The way you get out of this is

307
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:31,946
to push a new command from the

308
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,486
Admin Console to remove this

309
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:35,885
single app mode setting.

310
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,486
Very useful to lock thousands of

311
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,116
devices simultaneously and more

312
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,176
or less permanently, but it does

313
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,926
require IT involvement.

314
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,406
We have seen situations where

315
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:48,826
people have forgotten to unlock

316
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,566
the iPads via this technology.

317
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:52,716
If you were a school, and you

318
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,836
locked all the iPads to the math

319
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,126
test, and you forgot to unlock

320
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:57,406
them, now nobody can do anything

321
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:58,956
until you remember to push out

322
00:08:58,956 --> 00:08:59,616
that next command.

323
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:01,746
It does require a supervised

324
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:04,376
device managed by MDM, and I

325
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,806
would say the main downside to

326
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:06,936
this is that developers really

327
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:07,936
have no control.

328
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:09,756
When you lock with single app

329
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,056
mode, the device immediately

330
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,376
locks, we're stuck in that

331
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:12,956
application.

332
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:13,666
Not very [inaudible].

333
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,786
Wouldn't it be interesting if --

334
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:19,296
wouldn't it be great if, as a

335
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:20,746
developer, you could control

336
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:22,706
exactly when that locking

337
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:23,136
happened?

338
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,006
Like, for instance, if you had a

339
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,916
medical practice like this, with

340
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,596
a patient management application

341
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:29,516
full of confidential

342
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:31,256
information, when the patient

343
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,576
arrives, wouldn't it be great if

344
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:33,826
you could hand them the iPad,

345
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,306
touch that button, and know that

346
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:38,566
the iPad is locked, the Home

347
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:39,926
button does not work while we

348
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,416
are on this screen.

349
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:43,506
And then once the patient fills

350
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:45,016
in all their information, they

351
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:48,636
might touch Check In, hand the

352
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:51,276
iPad back to me, and now it

353
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,096
could be unlocked, and we would

354
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,646
regain full control.

355
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,366
Wouldn't it be great if clicking

356
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,596
that button right there, right

357
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:00,686
there, wouldn't it be great if

358
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:01,776
clicking that button right there

359
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:02,966
turned locking on?

360
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:03,956
>> Yeah!

361
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,186
>> Yes, yes, you're right.

362
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:05,876
It would be great.

363
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:06,476
Wouldn't that be great?

364
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:07,136
What about this side?

365
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:09,636
This side, you think that would

366
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:09,866
be great?

367
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:09,933
>> Yeah.

368
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:10,696
>> Yeah, it would be kind of

369
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:11,266
cool, wouldn't it?

370
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,026
Well, you know what, have we got

371
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:13,826
a function for you.

372
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:15,506
Well, as a matter of fact, that

373
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:16,626
would be great, and we do have a

374
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,256
function for you.

375
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,706
[ Applause ]

376
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,156
.

377
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:23,586
And here it is.

378
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:25,716
UIAccessibilityRequest

379
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,556
GuidedAccessSession.

380
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:29,736
Nice, easy-to-remember function.

381
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,146
UIAccessibilityRequest

382
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:32,656
GuidedAccessSession.

383
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,566
That turns locking on and off.

384
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,276
Here's another function.

385
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:37,886
Is Guided Access Enabled?

386
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:38,466
It's a Boolean.

387
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,406
Is it on or off?

388
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:39,896
You can check.

389
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:42,106
And there's a notification

390
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,016
you've asked for.

391
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,176
You can be alerted when the

392
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:45,156
status changes.

393
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:46,306
But mostly, there's this

394
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:46,806
function here,

395
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:48,336
UIAccessibilityRequest

396
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:49,776
GuidedAccessSession.

397
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:50,726
This is the key.

398
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:52,896
If your device and your

399
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:54,696
application are set up the right

400
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,846
way, and there is some setup

401
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,876
required, then your app can call

402
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,556
this function lock the iPad

403
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:00,826
right now, and it can call it

404
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,356
again to unlock.

405
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,236
And let me underline that.

406
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:05,576
If the iPad and your application

407
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:08,016
are set up the right way, this

408
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,356
is a powerful function that is

409
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,616
not available to all

410
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:11,346
applications.

411
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,806
Adding the code is important,

412
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,706
but there's some other steps you

413
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,326
actually have to do.

414
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,786
So speaking of code, let's see

415
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:19,626
some code.

416
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,356
You would call this function to

417
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,246
start a locking session.

418
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,976
You would pass it either true or

419
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,556
false.

420
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:27,216
Do you want to lock?

421
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,466
Do you want to unlock?

422
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:30,926
And you would also give it a

423
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:32,236
completion handler that would be

424
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:33,516
called when your request

425
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:34,626
completes.

426
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,846
It can take a second or two for

427
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:37,526
the locking to take effect, so

428
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:39,116
you pass a completion handler,

429
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,506
and your completion handler gets

430
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,156
a Boolean parameter that

431
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,576
indicates whether the request

432
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:45,866
succeeded or not.

433
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,956
It's possible that the request

434
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,196
could fail, and so you want to

435
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,066
actually check that.

436
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,326
But if all goes well, you can

437
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,406
check if the request succeed and

438
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,106
now do something with the

439
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,326
confidence that the iPad is

440
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:58,466
locked at this point, and the

441
00:11:58,466 --> 00:11:59,826
Home button is disabled.

442
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:01,676
So in our hypothetical medical

443
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,276
example, let's suppose we have a

444
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:04,796
function like this that loads

445
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:05,876
New View Controller with a

446
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,346
patient check-in screen on in.

447
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,276
you could wrap that in code like

448
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,396
this, and then that transition

449
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,266
would only happen if the device

450
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,836
had been locked successfully.

451
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,106
Then when the patient is done,

452
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,346
you've got some other function

453
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,336
that transitions back to the

454
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:20,536
main screen, you would put

455
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:21,436
something like this in here.

456
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:21,796
You would say

457
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:23,256
UIAccessibilityRequest

458
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,746
GuidedAccessSession false, and

459
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,246
that's a request to turn off at

460
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,386
app lock at that point.

461
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,856
There's another one you can

462
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:33,406
call.

463
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:34,806
Is Guided Access enabled, true

464
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:35,306
or false?

465
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,566
You can do some extra checks.

466
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:38,126
You can check at any time

467
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:38,866
whether you're currently in a

468
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,426
locked state or not.

469
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,016
There's also a notification,

470
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,636
UIAccessibilityRequest

471
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,696
GuidedAccessStatusDidChange, and

472
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,766
you can register for this, and

473
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,796
your app can be notified

474
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,016
anywhere as the status turns on

475
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,276
and off.

476
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,336
So all this technology taken

477
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,836
together is called autonomous

478
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,826
single app mode, ASAM.

479
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,136
It's like single app mode, but

480
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,256
it's autonomous, because your

481
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:01,876
app can control exactly when the

482
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,056
locking and unlocking takes

483
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:03,366
place.

484
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,476
You can lock just part of an

485
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:05,016
application.

486
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,596
Now for this to work, iPads do

487
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:08,766
need to be set up in a

488
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,346
particular way.

489
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:10,496
Let's talk about the

490
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:11,156
requirements.

491
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,246
The first requirement, you have

492
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:12,886
to write the code.

493
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:14,186
You have to call that function.

494
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:16,136
Second requirement, the devices

495
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:17,936
have to be supervised, which is

496
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:19,746
a sort of extreme form of iOS

497
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:20,206
management.

498
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,796
And thirdly, your app needs to

499
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,596
be white listed by the MDM

500
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,496
administrator.

501
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,026
The administrator can grant

502
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,706
permission to call this function

503
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,256
only to certain applications.

504
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,216
So here's what an admin would

505
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:33,506
do.

506
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:36,396
In an MDM tool, there's a place

507
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:37,676
where you can mark which

508
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,066
applications are allowed to

509
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,826
enter and exit single app mode.

510
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:43,516
Only the applications on this

511
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,346
list will allow that function to

512
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:46,606
work.

513
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,116
So you'd list exactly which apps

514
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:49,116
are allowed to use it here.

515
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,666
And remember, this only works on

516
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,886
supervised iPads, not iPads that

517
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:55,636
people are bringing from home.

518
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,096
Ultimately, this converts to a

519
00:13:58,096 --> 00:13:59,236
particular key and value in a

520
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,316
configuration profile.

521
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:01,816
The bundle IDs of all the apps

522
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:02,776
that are authorized to do this,

523
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:03,626
that's transmitted to the

524
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:04,066
device.

525
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,136
And once that configuration is

526
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,456
set up, your app can actually

527
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,596
call that function and turn the

528
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:11,446
locking on and off, and you have

529
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:11,816
control.

530
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,756
It's autonomous single app mode.

531
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,746
You can prevent people from

532
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:15,716
accidentally getting or

533
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,196
deliberately getting out of the

534
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:17,766
application.

535
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,846
However, there are a couple of

536
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:21,446
issues.

537
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:23,236
It does require an MDM managed

538
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:26,076
and supervised device, and the

539
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:26,936
IT department has to

540
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:29,486
specifically white list your

541
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,586
application, grant it

542
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:31,326
permission.

543
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,006
And all this is really onerous

544
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,276
in some situations.

545
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:37,636
It's ideal for the patient

546
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:39,156
check-in scenario or the

547
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,236
scenario with the bank where the

548
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:42,716
mortgage specialist is handing

549
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,786
you the iPad to fill in your

550
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:44,276
information.

551
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,176
We want to lock it right then.

552
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,016
It's great for that kind of

553
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,656
scenario, but it's not really

554
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,356
robust enough for assessment,

555
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,106
for testing.

556
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,686
Testing has its own set of

557
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:54,696
requirements.

558
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,396
If you're delivering a test to a

559
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,546
large group of students, it's a

560
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,456
kind of a high-stakes scenario.

561
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:00,756
Not only are the students going

562
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:03,276
to be judged on their knowledge,

563
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,236
but the teacher and the school

564
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:06,206
are going to be judged on the

565
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:06,916
results as well.

566
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:07,876
So it's important that we

567
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,696
deliver a test in an application

568
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,206
with the highest possible

569
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:11,876
integrity.

570
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,656
We don't want students cheating.

571
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:15,356
That's what we're talking about

572
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:15,476
here.

573
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:16,636
We want to make it hard for

574
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:17,356
students to cheat.

575
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:19,516
These three technologies are

576
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:20,866
useful in other scenarios, but

577
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:23,086
not in an assessment scenario,

578
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,216
because they leave certain

579
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,356
features running, like

580
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:27,646
spellchecking and then the

581
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:28,766
dictionary lookups and so.

582
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:29,756
Those are still running in these

583
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,086
other scenarios, and you

584
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,256
wouldn't want that in a test.

585
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,466
So Apple recommends automatic

586
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,056
assessment configuration as the

587
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,156
method that a test builder

588
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,166
should adopt.

589
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,346
What is it?

590
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,766
Well, assessment apps have

591
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:44,856
unique challenges.

592
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,236
That are a whole lot of very

593
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,906
useful features on iPad that are

594
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:51,126
not appropriate when a test is

595
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:52,286
actually running.

596
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,166
In order to protect the

597
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,576
integrity of the test, we're

598
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:56,826
going to want to disable things

599
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:59,656
like copying and pasting from

600
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,166
outside the test into the test.

601
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:02,526
We're going to want to disable,

602
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,846
obviously, other applications.

603
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:04,816
But we're also going to want to

604
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,526
disable spellchecking on an

605
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:07,486
English test, and we're going to

606
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,606
want to disable the built-in

607
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:09,616
dictionary.

608
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,186
So you need to be able to

609
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,346
disable certain hardware

610
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:16,336
features to run a secure test,

611
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,026
and you might not have

612
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,036
considered this, but you also

613
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:21,396
need to disable sharing off the

614
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:21,666
iPad.

615
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,096
We can't have a student copying

616
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:26,566
all the questions and using the

617
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:27,856
Share menu to ship them off to

618
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,166
another iPad of another student

619
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,506
outside.

620
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:30,446
We need to turn off that

621
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:31,766
universal clipboard as well.

622
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,676
In fact, we need to turn off a

623
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:34,426
whole lot of things.

624
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,166
You really do need to turn off

625
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,316
all these features like this to

626
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,266
run a safe and secure test.

627
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:42,586
This combination of locking iOS,

628
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,816
as I showed you before, plus

629
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:46,536
automatically disabling all

630
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,606
these features is called

631
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,476
automatic assessment

632
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,076
configuration.

633
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,546
Now AAC, automatic assessment

634
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,436
configuration, works just the

635
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:56,916
way I showed you with ASAM.

636
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,256
It's the exact same function.

637
00:16:58,256 --> 00:16:59,316
You call a function true to

638
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,796
lock, false to unlock.

639
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:01,616
You check the status.

640
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:03,536
Exactly the same process right

641
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:03,706
there.

642
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:05,776
But in addition, the moment you

643
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:07,736
lock with this function, all

644
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,806
these features are going to be

645
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,656
automatically disabled for the

646
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,276
duration of your test, and when

647
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,316
you call the unlock function,

648
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:15,016
they're all enabled.

649
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,156
There is a requirement here.

650
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:22,915
This works on any iPad, whether

651
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:24,516
it's managed or not, but it's a

652
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:25,726
pretty powerful technique, so

653
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:26,996
you need to have a special

654
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,016
entitlement in your application

655
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,336
before that request will

656
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:30,816
succeed.

657
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:32,726
Technically, the request is

658
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,246
called com.apple.developer.

659
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:35,546
edu-assessment-mode.

660
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,096
You need to apply to Apple for

661
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:39,516
this entitlement, and once you

662
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,686
have it, your application will

663
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,856
be able to lock and unlock with

664
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,556
no need for a supervised device

665
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:46,036
and no need for white listing.

666
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,576
Your app needs to be built with

667
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:48,936
a profile that includes this

668
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:50,036
special entitlement.

669
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,996
And once it locks, well, how

670
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:53,616
does it unlock?

671
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,666
Well, the device is locked.

672
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,756
Normally, it would unlock,

673
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:57,876
because at the end of the test,

674
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,996
you would call the function that

675
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,346
says false, time to end our

676
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:02,266
session, the student has

677
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,006
submitted the answers.

678
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,706
But the iPad also unlocks if the

679
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:06,486
user reboots it.

680
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,676
This isn't like single app mode

681
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:08,916
where we permanently keep you in

682
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,416
a device.

683
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:11,326
It's a temporary single app

684
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:11,526
mode.

685
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:13,966
And it also unlocks after eight

686
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:14,396
hours.

687
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:17,166
This is a -- if you are

688
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,356
administering a particular long

689
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:20,676
test, you might want to be aware

690
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:20,976
of this.

691
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,456
You will get a notification that

692
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:23,896
the locked status has changed,

693
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:24,806
and you could take that

694
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:25,996
opportunity to lock it again.

695
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,426
Let me know if you're creating a

696
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:29,706
test that takes eight hours to

697
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:30,086
finish.

698
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:31,026
I do not want to write that

699
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:31,696
particular test.

700
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:34,126
But what people see when they're

701
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,406
doing this is this.

702
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,166
This is a sample application.

703
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,566
There's sample code associated

704
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:39,406
with this session that you can

705
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:39,806
download.

706
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:41,596
Two buttons that turn locking on

707
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:41,876
and off.

708
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:43,886
This app was built with the

709
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:45,256
right entitlement, and there's a

710
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:46,496
text field where you can try

711
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,856
typing to see if spellchecking

712
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,346
works, and there's a log of what

713
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:51,456
happens.

714
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:54,016
When you tap the Enable App Lock

715
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,156
here and call that function I've

716
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,856
been talking about, this panel

717
00:18:57,856 --> 00:18:59,116
is automatically displayed.

718
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,926
The gives the user the

719
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,236
opportunity to say yes or no,

720
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:03,166
they are willing to enter the

721
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,256
lock session.

722
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:08,746
And if they tap yes, a banner

723
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:09,906
automatically appears at the top

724
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:10,936
that says your iPad is now

725
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,196
locked, and it's going to unlock

726
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:13,486
after eight hours or when you

727
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,336
finish the test, and then that

728
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:16,856
goes away after five seconds.

729
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,736
Now the iPad is locked until

730
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,846
such time as somebody runs,

731
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:23,426
calls the function to unlock.

732
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,106
In this demo app, tapping the

733
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:26,706
red button calls the unlock

734
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:27,636
function, then you get another

735
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:28,656
banner across the top.

736
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:30,376
"Your iPad is no longer locked."

737
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:31,616
In between the green and the

738
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,016
red, the Home button was

739
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:34,916
successful disabled, and this is

740
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,696
a pretty simple sample

741
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:37,706
application.

742
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,736
Just two buttons with two action

743
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:40,056
methods.

744
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,676
One calls the function with true

745
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:42,166
to lock.

746
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,816
The other one says false to

747
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,116
unlock.

748
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,606
Let's talk about some of the

749
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,836
considerations in here.

750
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:48,796
It's pretty good that the apps

751
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,096
can lock and unlock themselves,

752
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,346
and it's great for assessment,

753
00:19:51,346 --> 00:19:52,416
that all these other features,

754
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,176
like spell check, are

755
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:54,416
automatically turned off in

756
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,816
addition to the locking.

757
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:56,666
You, the developer, have

758
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,246
control, and this doesn't

759
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:59,936
require a managed device.

760
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,366
In a school situation, this will

761
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,586
work on a device the student

762
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:03,846
brings from home.

763
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,946
However, you do need this

764
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,336
particular app entitlement in

765
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:10,496
your application, and this

766
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:12,106
entitlement is only for

767
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,156
assessment developers.

768
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,236
How would you implement this in

769
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:17,446
your app?

770
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,316
Well, the first step is to

771
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,646
actually apply to Apple for this

772
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:21,486
entitlement, which will be

773
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,996
granted to assessment developers

774
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,016
but not to anybody else, and

775
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:25,586
then you build a provisioning

776
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:26,746
profile that includes that

777
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:28,276
entitlement, and build your app

778
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:28,956
with that profile.

779
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:30,796
The way you ask for this

780
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,966
entitlement is to submit a tech

781
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,786
support incident, and tell us,

782
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:35,766
tell Apple that you would like

783
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:36,986
the education assessment mode

784
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:37,886
entitlement.

785
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,896
And then once that's been

786
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:42,076
granted to you, you can go to

787
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:43,766
the developer portal and build a

788
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,576
new profile that includes that

789
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:47,076
entitlement.

790
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:48,616
You will only see this selection

791
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:49,706
here if you've been granted the

792
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,586
entitlement, and you can now

793
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:51,736
build a provisioning profile

794
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:53,226
that has this special

795
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:55,486
entitlement in it.

796
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:56,676
Don't forget this step.

797
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:57,626
It's not enough for Apple to

798
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:58,586
grant you the entitlement.

799
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,716
You have to create a profile

800
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,296
that has it embedded, and

801
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,196
download it, and use it in

802
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:04,606
Xcode.

803
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:07,486
Also, don't forget that you want

804
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,386
to apply this to several

805
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,276
different profiles.

806
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:10,356
It's not enough just to put the

807
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,986
entitlement in your development

808
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:12,356
profile.

809
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:12,926
You should put it in the

810
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:14,476
distribution one, and if you've

811
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:15,616
done it correctly, you should

812
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:19,066
see here in Xcode, once you

813
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,296
select a profile with this

814
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,926
entitlement in it, you can touch

815
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,356
that little info button, and you

816
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:24,336
can see the entitlements that

817
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:24,986
are built in here.

818
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:25,896
That's the way to confirm that

819
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:26,656
you're doing this right.

820
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,826
If you see that magic string

821
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,856
there, com.apple.developer.

822
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,976
edu-assessment-mode, you're good

823
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:32,236
to go.

824
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:33,546
You can now build an application

825
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,166
that actually uses this

826
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:35,606
technology.

827
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:38,876
When would you do it?

828
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:39,696
Well, when you're ready to enter

829
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,106
the test, you'd call the magic

830
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,006
function with true, and when

831
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:42,646
you're ready to get out of the

832
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:43,926
test, you'd call it with false,

833
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,396
and it's very important to check

834
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,236
whether it worked or not,

835
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:46,816
because there were some

836
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:47,946
scenarios where it can fail.

837
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,236
I'm going to try actually doing

838
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:49,346
this.

839
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:50,166
I'm going to try actually

840
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,366
building something that they

841
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:51,926
used this year.

842
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:55,266
Take my life in my hands here.

843
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:58,686
So you remember this testing

844
00:21:58,686 --> 00:21:59,666
application that I showed you

845
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,126
before.

846
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:02,206
I have a secure version and an

847
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:03,696
insecure version of it on this

848
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:03,966
iPad.

849
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:05,286
I'm going to show you the

850
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,516
insecure version, just to

851
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:07,796
highlight some of the problems

852
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:09,016
that might come up in a test,

853
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:10,906
then I'm going to change the

854
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:13,166
insecure version into the secure

855
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:13,456
version.

856
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:16,776
This is the insecure version of

857
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:17,626
the test.

858
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,726
If I touch Start Test, I could

859
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,426
do all kinds of cheating things.

860
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,826
I could look up Canada in the

861
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:24,486
built-in dictionary.

862
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:25,226
Oh, there's the capitol right

863
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:25,356
there.

864
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:25,776
It's Ottawa.

865
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,016
That's pretty good.

866
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:29,036
Let's assume that we've blocked

867
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:29,636
the Home button.

868
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:30,666
Even if we've blocked the Home

869
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,716
button, a lot of other stuff is

870
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:32,186
possible.

871
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,526
If I type my answer up here,

872
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,786
O-T-T, I'm getting suggestions

873
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,486
in the completion bar that

874
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,376
happen to include the correct

875
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:39,806
answer.

876
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:41,616
You'd probably like to disable

877
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:43,096
that in a test as well.

878
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,366
You should probably disable the

879
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:48,896
share sheet.

880
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:50,726
We do not want students sending

881
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,936
the questions to their friends

882
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:53,816
somewhere else.

883
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:54,866
All this stuff needs to be

884
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:56,856
disabled in addition to the Home

885
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:57,026
button.

886
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,346
I mean, my Home button's still

887
00:22:58,346 --> 00:22:58,686
working here.

888
00:22:58,686 --> 00:22:59,486
That's the first problem.

889
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:00,706
So I'm going to show you the

890
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:01,736
code for this particular

891
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:04,106
application here, and then we're

892
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:05,646
going to try turning this into a

893
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:06,686
secure version.

894
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:09,716
So this is really a "nothing

895
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:09,956
app."

896
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,046
I put no effort into this

897
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:11,756
application at all.

898
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:12,456
It's a couple of view

899
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:13,626
controllers, and we touch the

900
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,796
Start the Test button, and it

901
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,766
loads another view controller

902
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:17,086
right here.

903
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:19,626
That's the time that we want to

904
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:20,756
turn locking on.

905
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:22,816
There are, however, a few

906
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:24,936
prerequisites that you have to

907
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:26,776
do before you can do this

908
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:27,786
locking dance.

909
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:31,596
First of all, you have to have a

910
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:32,696
provisioning profile with the

911
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:33,636
right entitlement in it.

912
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:34,886
You have to have applied to

913
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,696
Apple for this entitlement, and

914
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,006
generated a provision profile

915
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:38,626
that includes it.

916
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:40,806
I fortunately have done that, so

917
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,116
I'm just going to change my code

918
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:45,666
signing right here to use this

919
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,246
provisioning profile, which I

920
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:48,816
have previously downloaded, and

921
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,736
it has the magic entitlement in

922
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:51,266
it.

923
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:54,216
I can verify that touching the

924
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:55,616
info button right here, and

925
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:57,106
you'll see that the

926
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:58,466
com.apple.developer.

927
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:00,606
edu-assessment-mode entitlement

928
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,216
is buried in here.

929
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:01,636
We're good.

930
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:03,326
I can compile an app now that

931
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:04,346
will use this particular

932
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:04,906
entitlement.

933
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:06,256
That's step one.

934
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:09,226
Step two is that Xcode these

935
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:11,866
days is particularly cautious,

936
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:14,576
I'll say, and Xcode wants you to

937
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:17,656
state exactly which entitlement

938
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,476
this app needs to use right now

939
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:21,446
by creating an entitlements

940
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:21,876
file.

941
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,366
It's not enough just to have the

942
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:24,796
provisioning profile with the

943
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,516
entitlement in it.

944
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,106
You also need an actual

945
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,096
entitlements file.

946
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:30,166
I've made one of these here.

947
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,356
Entitlements files are just keys

948
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:33,306
and values like that.

949
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:35,526
So I'm going to add this.

950
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:36,416
This is the awkward part of the

951
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:36,666
demo.

952
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,346
I'm going to add this

953
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:38,816
entitlements file to my project,

954
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:42,076
and I'm going to go to the build

955
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:43,346
settings, my favorite part of

956
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:44,446
Xcode, looking around at the

957
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:47,746
build settings for the

958
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:50,066
entitlements, and I'm going to

959
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,166
tell it that I want to use that

960
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,266
file, AAC.entitlements.

961
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,186
I'm specifying that that's my

962
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,546
entitlements file specifying

963
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:58,696
that, yes, I really do want to

964
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:02,316
use education assessment.

965
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:05,066
All right.

966
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:06,266
Now I think we're okay to go.

967
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,076
Now I think we're okay to go.

968
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:08,376
This is still an insecure test,

969
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:09,436
because it's not making any

970
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:10,836
effort to call the locking

971
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:11,786
function, so I'm going to put

972
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:11,996
that in.

973
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:14,056
I'm going to put a lock around

974
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,306
this present line right here.

975
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,366
Here we go.

976
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:21,206
[inaudible] Apple we have these

977
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:24,066
little shortcuts ready to go.

978
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,806
This is the block of code that I

979
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:26,456
just pasted in.

980
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:27,826
We're going to request a Guided

981
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,316
Access session with the

982
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:30,456
parameter true.

983
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:31,876
True means lock, yes, now.

984
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,626
And if it succeeds, we're going

985
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:34,166
to do one thing.

986
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:35,626
If it fails, we're going to do

987
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,366
another thing.

988
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:37,746
So I'm going to move this line

989
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,446
of code up into that if block up

990
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:40,626
there.

991
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:43,666
By the way, if you take nothing

992
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:44,626
else home from this session,

993
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,866
command option left bracket

994
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:48,376
moves lines of code up, and

995
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:49,606
command option right bracket

996
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:50,126
moves them down.

997
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,106
This is the greatest thing.

998
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:54,066
Hey, oh, look at that fun.

999
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:56,636
Anyway, we is now put that

1000
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:57,696
inside this if statement.

1001
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:58,746
So we're going to request a

1002
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:00,156
lock, and if it succeeded ,

1003
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:01,036
we're going to present the other

1004
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:01,626
view controller.

1005
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,866
It's important to pair the locks

1006
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:06,166
with the unlocks.

1007
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,416
You have to have some way of

1008
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,896
unlocking the application.

1009
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,526
And in this particularly

1010
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,136
extremely simple app , I'm just

1011
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:13,206
going to do it here.

1012
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,686
Every time this main test picker

1013
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:15,936
view shows up on the screen,

1014
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,186
we're going to unlock.

1015
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,896
This is an unlock call to that

1016
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:21,266
function.

1017
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,556
We're passing it false to say

1018
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:24,406
please try to unlock the device.

1019
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,476
So we lock the device when we

1020
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:27,806
leave the test picker screen,

1021
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:28,666
and we unlock it when we come

1022
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,866
back to the test picker screen.

1023
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:31,676
I think we're okay here.

1024
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,196
Let's find out.

1025
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:40,906
Try running this.

1026
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:43,526
And here it is.

1027
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:46,226
So I'm going to choose the

1028
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:47,406
geography test, and I'm going to

1029
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:48,226
touch Start Test.

1030
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:49,206
That's when the lock code is

1031
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:49,546
invoked.

1032
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:50,566
I'll touch Start Test.

1033
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:51,706
now it's asking me.

1034
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:53,286
Now it's asking me the user to

1035
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:55,166
confirm that we like to enter

1036
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:56,756
single app mode for the duration

1037
00:26:56,756 --> 00:26:57,986
of eight hours or until the test

1038
00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:58,966
is over, and I'll say yes.

1039
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:02,936
Now that I'm in the geography

1040
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:03,846
test, you'll see the banner at

1041
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:05,076
the top advising me that would

1042
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:06,446
like for the next eight hours or

1043
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:07,306
until the test is over.

1044
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:09,056
I can't look anything up here

1045
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:09,566
anymore.

1046
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,736
That had the look up button on

1047
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:12,446
it before.

1048
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:12,946
I could have looked up the

1049
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:14,096
answer in Wikipedia, but that's

1050
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:15,806
been automatically turned off.

1051
00:27:16,816 --> 00:27:18,686
My spell checking has been

1052
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:21,066
automatically turned off down

1053
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:21,436
here.

1054
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:23,346
we're really taking all the fun

1055
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:24,756
things out of the iPad here for

1056
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:25,816
the duration of this test here,

1057
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:26,626
just to ensure that we have a

1058
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:27,646
test with some integrity here.

1059
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,966
The capital of Canada is Ottawa.

1060
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:32,656
Alright. And when I touch the

1061
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:33,946
Submit button, we return to this

1062
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:36,496
screen, and ASAM is turned off

1063
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:37,476
with the other function I put

1064
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:37,556
in.

1065
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,896
now the Home button is now

1066
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:39,516
working.

1067
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:41,226
So the Home button was not

1068
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,006
working while we were in the

1069
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:42,456
test.

1070
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:44,376
All those cheating services were

1071
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,496
not working either, and once we

1072
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,826
exited the test, everything was

1073
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:48,006
fine.

1074
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:48,926
I'm feeling kind of confident

1075
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:49,026
here.

1076
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:49,796
I want to try another test.

1077
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:50,586
I think I did okay in the

1078
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:51,626
geography test.

1079
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:52,216
Let's try another one here.

1080
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:53,856
Spelling. I'm good at spelling.

1081
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:55,606
So we'll lock as we go into the

1082
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:56,296
spelling test.

1083
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:59,256
Here are my spelling words.

1084
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:00,046
What's that?

1085
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:00,916
>> Schnauzer.

1086
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,726
>> Schnauzer, okay.

1087
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:02,546
Can I have the definition of

1088
00:28:02,546 --> 00:28:03,016
"schnauzer"?

1089
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:05,096
>> A medium or small-sized dog

1090
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,666
of a German breed with a closed

1091
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,356
wiry coat and heavy whiskers

1092
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:09,306
around the muzzle.

1093
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:10,176
>> Okay, I think I can spell

1094
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:10,266
that.

1095
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:10,936
Can I have it in a sentence,

1096
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:11,256
please?

1097
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,496
>> Get a load of that guy's

1098
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:13,066
schnauzer.

1099
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:13,816
>> All right, schnauzer.

1100
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:14,436
Let's see here.

1101
00:28:14,436 --> 00:28:14,503
[laughter].

1102
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:18,366
>> S-C-H-N-A-U.

1103
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:19,926
>> You notice I'm not getting

1104
00:28:19,926 --> 00:28:21,376
any typing situations here.

1105
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:21,986
>> Zed.

1106
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:24,346
>> Zed, thank you.

1107
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:25,096
From Canada.

1108
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:25,686
>> E-R. [ringing].

1109
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:25,956
>> Hey, all right.

1110
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,086
I got that one right.

1111
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:28,296
I'm feeling kind of cocky.

1112
00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:29,446
I want to try another word.

1113
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:30,096
I want to try another word.

1114
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:30,886
I got ten minutes left.

1115
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:31,766
I'll do a couple more words in

1116
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:32,306
the spelling test.

1117
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:32,866
What do you say?

1118
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:33,976
Let's try one more word in the

1119
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:34,556
spelling test.

1120
00:28:34,556 --> 00:28:35,156
>> Syzygy.

1121
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:36,106
>> Uh-oh. What?

1122
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:36,866
>> Syzygy.

1123
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:37,376
>> Syzygy?

1124
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,006
>> Syzygy.

1125
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:39,866
>> Can I have the definition.

1126
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,846
>> A conjunction or opposition.

1127
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:42,976
>> That's not really helping me.

1128
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:43,206
>> Syzygy.

1129
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,056
>> Can you use it in a sentence.

1130
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:46,616
>> Your spelling bee word is

1131
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:47,506
"syzygy."

1132
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:51,916
>> Okay. Man, I don't know.

1133
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:55,966
>> S-Y-Z-Y-G-Y.

1134

1136
00:28:56,316 --> 00:28:56,836
>> Hey, all right.

1137
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:57,836
One more, one more.

1138
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,526
I'm feeling pretty good here.

1139
00:28:58,526 --> 00:28:59,376
One more, one more here.

1140
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:00,396
Let's try one here.

1141
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:00,886
>> Calfafa [phonetic].

1142
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:01,896
>> What's that again?

1143

1173

So it's pretty straightforward

1174
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,376
to actually add this to your

1175
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,566
application once you have that

1176
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:44,096
entitlement.

1177
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:44,666
I've got to remind you.

1178
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:45,226
You've got to get that

1179
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:46,836
entitlement from Apple before

1180
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:49,046
the locking and the disabling is

1181
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:49,526
going to work.

1182
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:51,636
Let's talk about a couple of

1183
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:52,626
other considerations.

1184
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:54,776
I've mentioned that the request

1185
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:57,806
to lock might fail, and that's

1186
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,166
true in the ASAM model where

1187
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,186
you're deploying to a supervised

1188
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:02,246
device and also the AAC model

1189
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,196
where you're deploying to any

1190
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:05,026
device with the entitlement.

1191
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,416
The request to lock can fail, so

1192
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,626
you really do need to check that

1193
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:07,916
parameter.

1194
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:10,216
In ASAM, it will fail if the

1195
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,356
device is not supervised and if

1196
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:13,506
the bundle identifier hasn't

1197
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:14,556
been set up properly.

1198
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:15,836
In other words, if the device is

1199
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:17,246
not being managed properly for

1200
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:18,966
your test, an ASAM request will

1201
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:20,776
fail.

1202
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:24,096
In AAC, it will fail if your app

1203
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,406
does not have this entitlement

1204
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:26,286
built in.

1205
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,176
In both cases, it will fail if

1206
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:31,126
the user hit "no" on that button

1207
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,026
where -- that panel where

1208
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:32,936
they're asked if they want to

1209
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:33,516
lock or not.

1210
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:35,386
But, and this is kind of weird,

1211
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:36,896
it will fail if the device is

1212
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:37,596
already locked.

1213
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,976
This is a little weird.

1214
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,886
If you make the lock request

1215
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:43,196
twice in a row, the first one

1216
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:43,896
will succeed.

1217
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:44,636
You'll be locked.

1218
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,976
If you ask to lock again, the

1219
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,736
second one will fail, but you'll

1220
00:30:47,736 --> 00:30:48,526
still be locked.

1221
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,486
So you have to be careful about

1222
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:52,866
this in the setup of an

1223
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,236
assessment application.

1224
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:55,866
All those restrictions of

1225
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:56,986
disabling the dictionary and

1226
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,796
spell checking, those are only

1227
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,546
there if it was your app that

1228
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,216
actually successfully called

1229
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:03,076
that

1230
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:05,046
UIRequestGuidedAccessSession

1231
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:06,146
function.

1232
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:07,716
If you were locked for some

1233
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:09,976
other reason, those restrictions

1234
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,966
are not going to be in place.

1235
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,066
So it is a good practice to

1236
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:14,546
check.

1237
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,716
Before you try to lock the

1238
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:16,936
device, check if it's already

1239
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:17,296
locked.

1240
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,456
Because if it already is locked,

1241
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:22,336
and you didn't do it, something

1242
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:22,956
is wrong.

1243
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,976
We're in an odd situation.

1244
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,066
Maybe somebody walked up and

1245
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:27,376
turned on Guided Access with the

1246
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,166
triple tap thing.

1247
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:29,646
If they did that, the

1248
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,266
restrictions are not going to be

1249
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:32,696
disabled properly.

1250
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:34,226
So it's important that you

1251
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,176
actually check.

1252
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,056
Here's one way.

1253
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:37,586
You can check when the app is

1254
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,116
launched.

1255
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,486
We suggest you wait for two

1256
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:41,286
seconds after app launch,

1257
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:42,326
because it takes a moment to

1258
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:43,886
lock everything, but you can

1259
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,436
check after app launch, call

1260
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,746
that Is GuidedAccessEnabled

1261
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:47,166
function.

1262
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:48,466
And if you are locked

1263
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,776
immediately after launch,

1264
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,536
something is wrong in your

1265
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:52,296
testing environment.

1266
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:52,966
You weren't supposed to be

1267
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:53,706
locked at this point.

1268
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:56,036
For a test, you should stop at

1269
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:56,416
that point.

1270
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,476
You should not proceed with the

1271
00:31:58,556 --> 00:31:58,886
test.

1272
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,226
Similarly, you should do a test

1273
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:02,816
before attempting to call the

1274
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,076
lock function.

1275
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:05,626
You should check that Guided

1276
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:06,656
Access is false,

1277
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,006
GuidedAccessEnabled is false

1278
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:08,906
before you try to lock.

1279
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:10,536
You want to make sure you're in

1280
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:12,706
the right state before you call

1281
00:32:12,706 --> 00:32:13,566
the locking the function to

1282
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:14,366
ensure that not only is the

1283
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,036
device locked, but it's locked

1284
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:17,126
with the restrictions.

1285
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:20,266
Here's another consideration for

1286
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,726
a standardized test.

1287
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:22,856
Probably a good idea to clear

1288
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:24,526
the paste board coming in and

1289
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,396
leaving your test.

1290
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:28,066
AAC automatically disables the

1291
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,746
universal clipboard for sharing

1292
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,566
to other devices, but you need

1293
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,666
to clear the built-in system

1294
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,026
paste board when the test starts

1295
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,726
to keep a child from copying the

1296
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,156
test in notes and then launching

1297
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:38,426
the app.

1298
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:39,226
You want to clear that out.

1299
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:40,206
You probably want to clear it on

1300
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:41,996
exit of the test as well, so

1301
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,206
they don't copy the questions

1302
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:44,156
and see it somewhere else.

1303
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:45,426
Pretty straightforward to do

1304
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:45,596
that.

1305
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,386
You just set the items of the

1306
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,496
general paste board to an empty

1307
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:48,766
array.

1308
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,646
You should probably consider

1309
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,446
disabling third party keyboards

1310
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:55,596
in an assessment app as well.

1311
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:57,796
Third party keyboards are app

1312
00:32:57,796 --> 00:32:59,006
extensions, and they're not

1313
00:32:59,006 --> 00:32:59,986
blocked by AAC.

1314
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:03,126
You might have an application

1315
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,606
like this, where the student has

1316
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:07,356
installed another keyboard which

1317
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:08,616
actually some keyboards actually

1318
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,996
support searching right in the

1319
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:10,506
keyboard.

1320
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:11,646
You could search for the capital

1321
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:12,406
of Canada right there in the

1322
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:13,756
keyboard and get the answer.

1323
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:15,096
That's probably not a good

1324
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:17,166
keyboard to use in a test.

1325
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:19,096
So as a developer of an

1326
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:20,316
assessment application, you can

1327
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:21,666
implement this function in your

1328
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,606
application delegate to allow or

1329
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,696
disallow specific types of

1330
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:26,996
extensions as they are being

1331
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:27,346
voted.

1332
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,896
I would suggest just disallowing

1333
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,256
all of them, especially

1334
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:30,796
keyboards.

1335
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,496
But disallow all extensions in a

1336
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:33,356
standardized test app.

1337
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:34,306
Remember, the goal is to take

1338
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,816
all the fun out of the iPad for

1339
00:33:35,886 --> 00:33:36,846
the duration of the test, and

1340
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,456
then restore the fun when we're

1341
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:38,736
done.

1342
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:41,266
Let me just review again the

1343
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,216
difference between these two

1344
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,416
techniques, because in software,

1345
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,416
they're exactly the same.

1346
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:46,516
You call this same function,

1347
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:48,626
UIAccessibilityRequest

1348
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,186
GuidedAccessSession, and the

1349
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:51,796
effect is different, depending

1350
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,746
on how the devices and your app

1351
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,166
are set up.

1352
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:58,066
The code is the same.

1353
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,156
You call that function.

1354
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:00,966
In each scenario, the device is

1355
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:01,256
locked.

1356
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,196
Remember though that in ASAM we

1357
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:04,096
have to be dealing with a

1358
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:05,646
managed and supervised device.

1359
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:07,626
In AAC, we can deal with any

1360
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:09,005
device, so long as your app has

1361
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:09,525
the entitlement.

1362
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,106
But the biggest difference is

1363
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,426
that AAC also turns off a whole

1364
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,606
bunch of other stuff for the

1365
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:16,005
duration of the locking session.

1366
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:17,356
So that is the technology you

1367
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,696
want to use if you're an

1368
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,666
assessment developer, to lock an

1369
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,146
application.

1370
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:22,576
Other developers may find that

1371
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:24,216
ASAM meets their needs, but AAC

1372
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:27,076
is specifically for assessment

1373
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:27,525
developers.

1374
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:30,485
So we talked about four ways to

1375
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,116
lock an app.

1376
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:32,496
Guided Access, lots of fun.

1377
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:33,516
Do that when you get home.

1378
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,295
Lock your children into the

1379
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:36,726
SpongeBob Squarepants

1380
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:37,876
application so that they can't

1381
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,496
look at your mail, and then

1382
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,106
that's a nice easy end user sort

1383
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:41,556
of thing to do.

1384
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:42,976
Works on any device with any

1385
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:43,366
app.

1386
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,126
Single app mode is good for

1387
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,376
kiosks, but it requires the

1388
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,476
administrator to push out a

1389
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:49,545
command to a fleet of managed

1390
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,766
supervised devices, and then

1391
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:51,906
they are pretty much permanently

1392
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,966
locked to the application.

1393
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:58,226
And then ASAM and AAC are the

1394
00:34:58,226 --> 00:34:59,786
same software function with two

1395
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:00,846
different effects, depending on

1396
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:01,306
the setup.

1397
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,426
Two different effects depending

1398
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:04,486
on whether your app has this

1399
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:05,826
entitlement and whether the

1400
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:07,426
devices are managed or not.

1401
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:10,846
So there's a bunch of related

1402
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:12,236
sessions at the conference.

1403
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,386
I hope you enjoyed all the

1404
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:14,376
related sessions.

1405
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:15,666
I like that second one on

1406
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:16,886
heifers and HVAC.

1407
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:17,696
I think that's the air

1408
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:18,726
conditioning for cows.

1409
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:19,576
Oh, I'm reading that wrong.

1410
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,056
HEIF and HEVC.

1411
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:21,956
A lot of our assessment

1412
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:23,486
developers deliver web content

1413
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:24,806
as part of their applications,

1414
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:25,306
so I think these are

1415
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,026
particularly relevant sessions

1416
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:27,696
for people to use.

1417
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,486
But for more information and for

1418
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:30,566
-- including a sample

1419
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:31,606
application that demonstrates

1420
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:33,546
how all this works, please take

1421
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:34,416
a look at the website here for

1422
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:36,216
Session 760.

1423
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:37,856
Thank you very much.

1424
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,446
Thank you for coming.

1425
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:39,986
I hope you enjoy the week.

1426
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:40,053
[ Applause ]

1427
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:40,216
Thank you.
