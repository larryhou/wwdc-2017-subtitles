00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,126
>> Hello everyone, and welcome

2
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:31,566
to Building Apps with Dynamic

3
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:31,696
Type.

4
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:34,096
My name is Clare, and together

5
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,436
with my colleague Nandini, I'm

6
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,576
excited to share with you how

7
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:37,976
you can make your apps work

8
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:40,466
great at any text size.

9
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,876
Today we'll first cover what

10
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,706
Dynamic Type is and why the

11
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:46,446
feature exists.

12
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,526
Next we'll look at what's new in

13
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:50,046
iOS 11 for Dynamic Type.

14
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,136
We'll follow that with some

15
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,866
guidelines and API you can apply

16
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,856
to your own apps, and finally

17
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,306
we'll show all of that hands-on

18
00:00:57,386 --> 00:00:58,906
in a sample app.

19
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,446
So first what is Dynamic Type.

20
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:08,606
Dynamic Type is a feature that

21
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,686
allows users to customize the

22
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:13,796
size of text on screen.

23
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:15,286
For example, some users may

24
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,626
prefer a smaller text size so

25
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:18,796
they can fit more content on

26
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:19,896
screen.

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,666
Others may prefer a larger text

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,596
size because it's more

29
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,086
comfortable to read.

30
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,926
But Dynamic Type goes beyond a

31
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:30,396
user's preferences.

32
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:34,946
Some users may experience eye

33
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,846
strain when viewing text at the

34
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,876
default size for long periods of

35
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:37,976
time.

36
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:43,716
Others may simply have less

37
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:45,756
acute vision due to aging.

38
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,026
And yet others may have a low

39
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:52,396
vision condition which makes it

40
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,776
impossible for them to read text

41
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,256
at the default size.

42
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:58,166
So for these users Dynamic Type

43
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,856
isn't just a preference, it's an

44
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,256
actual need and by supporting

45
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,936
Dynamic Type in your apps, you

46
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,646
can allow these users to use

47
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:06,436
your app and have a great

48
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:06,976
experience with it.

49
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:13,416
The Dynamic Type settings can be

50
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,106
found in the Settings app under

51
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:15,996
Display and Brightness.

52
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,896
It starts out with seven

53
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:18,976
different text sizes you can

54
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,616
choose from, and the default one

55
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,236
is in the middle.

56
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:25,306
You can also go into your

57
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,986
Accessibility settings and there

58
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:29,816
you can enable five even larger

59
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,496
sizes.

60
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,596
Those sizes are geared towards

61
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:34,556
users with low vision.

62
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,306
They range from somewhat larger

63
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:40,796
than default size to much

64
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:41,166
larger.

65
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:43,746
Now, looking at this you might

66
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,686
be wondering whether you really

67
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,236
need text to get that big.

68
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,906
Let's look in the example of why

69
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:49,906
this is useful.

70
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:56,376
So here's the phone app and on

71
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,186
the left we've got it at the

72
00:02:58,186 --> 00:03:00,076
largest size, not including the

73
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,166
Accessibility sizes.

74
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,726
On the right we have it at the

75
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,406
larger size overall.

76
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:06,946
Now let's look at this through

77
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:07,806
the lens of a user with low

78
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:07,976
vision.

79
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,216
Someone with low vision might

80
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,286
see something closer to what we

81
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:15,146
see here.

82
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,426
Notice how the version on the

83
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:18,646
left is completely unreadable,

84
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,786
but the version on the right is

85
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,126
still fairly readable, even

86
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:22,716
though its blurry.

87
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,706
So text size makes a huge

88
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,426
difference for the legibility of

89
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,726
your apps and that's why it's

90
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:29,626
really important that you

91
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,086
support the full range of

92
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:31,976
Dynamic Type sizes.

93
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,546
So that's what Dynamic Type is,

94
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,766
and now let's look at what's new

95
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,326
in iOS 11 for Dynamic Type.

96
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:44,596
The biggest thing that's changed

97
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,336
is that Dynamic Type support is

98
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:48,266
vastly improved and expanded

99
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,106
across all of iOS.

100
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,566
When we started working on iOS

101
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,776
11, we had three goals in mind.

102
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,716
First, text should be large

103
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,846
enough for the user to read.

104
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,096
In other words, text should

105
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,526
scale with Dynamic Type.

106
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:07,926
Second, the text should be fully

107
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:08,416
readable.

108
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:09,976
It shouldn't be truncated

109
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,706
unnecessarily and it shouldn't

110
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:12,976
be overlapped or clipping.

111
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,766
And third, we want an app UI to

112
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,486
look beautiful at all text

113
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:19,956
sizes.

114
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:23,416
Now, for more information on the

115
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,436
design thinking behind the iOS

116
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:26,986
11 Dynamic Type improvements,

117
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:28,166
please check out the Design for

118
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:28,976
Everyone talk from yesterday.

119
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,906
So now let's look at some

120
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,076
examples of what's changed.

121
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,266
Here's the Settings app.

122
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:38,856
Notice how it now adapts

123
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,326
beautifully for all the text

124
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:40,916
sizes.

125
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,106
Here's another example from

126
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:45,566
Calendar.

127
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,546
Notice how text everywhere is

128
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:49,576
scaling with Dynamic Type, and

129
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,786
some texts, like the event time,

130
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:53,386
is laid out differently to

131
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:53,976
accommodate larger text.

132
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,356
Now, there are some cases where

133
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,626
we don't scale for Dynamic Type.

134
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,346
For example, in tab bars, if we

135
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,076
were to scale a text here, the

136
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,386
tab bar would take away too much

137
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,596
room from the main content.

138
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,226
However, now, in iOS 11, if you

139
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,646
have one of the five largest

140
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,106
Dynamic Type settings chosen,

141
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,516
you can long press on one of the

142
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:19,496
items in the tab bar.

143
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,476
For example, the Voicemail tab,

144
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,146
and that will show a larger

145
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:24,826
version in the middle of the

146
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:24,976
screen.

147
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,276
So that's a sampling of what's

148
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,256
changed in iOS 11.

149
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:34,866
Now let's look at some

150
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,266
guidelines in API that you can

151
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,036
apply to your own apps.

152
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,586
We'll be covering this in four

153
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:41,096
areas.

154
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,336
First, we'll look at how you can

155
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,656
scale your font sizes for

156
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:45,226
Dynamic Type.

157
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,356
Second, we'll see how you can

158
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,226
accommodate larger text in your

159
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:50,776
app's layouts.

160
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,746
Third, we'll look at the

161
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,456
specific, very common case of

162
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,296
table views.

163
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,726
And then finally, we'll even see

164
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,676
how images can work well with

165
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:00,976
Dynamic Type.

166
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,616
So first, let's scale font sizes

167
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,166
for Dynamic Type.

168
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,666
The easiest way to do this is to

169
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,256
use the built-in text styles

170
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:15,226
that come with iOS.

171
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,646
Here's a list of all of our text

172
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:19,896
styles, along with their font

173
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,776
sizes at the default text size.

174
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:24,346
If your user has a different

175
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,216
text size selected, these font

176
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:26,856
sizes will also change.

177
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,456
Now, for those of you who have

178
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,796
already be using text styles in

179
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:36,626
your app, first, thank you; and

180
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,126
second, there's one important

181
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:39,456
change in iOS 11 that you should

182
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:39,986
be aware of.

183
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,476
Prior to iOS 11 all the text

184
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,166
style adapted for the seven

185
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,246
standard sizes.

186
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,336
However, only the body style

187
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,796
adapted for the five

188
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:52,296
accessibility sizes.

189
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:56,506
In iOS 11 all of the text style

190
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,506
adapt for all 12 text sizes.

191
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,116
And so if you're using text

192
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,246
styles, you'll get support for

193
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:01,966
all 12 sizes for free.

194
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:09,066
To use text styles in Interface

195
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:10,566
Builder, go to the Attribute

196
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,756
Inspector and change the font on

197
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:14,176
your view.

198
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,236
By default this will be

199
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,286
something like System 17 point,

200
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,706
which means it's not going to

201
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,806
scale with Dynamic Type.

202
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,946
But if you click on that T icon,

203
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:24,106
you can choose one of the text

204
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,436
style fonts instead and those

205
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:25,976
will scale.

206
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,986
Also, new in iOS 11 you can

207
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:33,656
check the Automatically Adjust

208
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:34,536
Font checkbox.

209
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,396
This means that if the user

210
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:38,226
changes their text size while

211
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,766
your app is running, your view

212
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,146
will automatically update its

213
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,476
font for the new text size.

214
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:43,456
So we highly recommend you check

215
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:43,976
this on all of your views.

216
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,296
In code it's just as easy to use

217
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:51,936
text styles.

218
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:52,756
You can use the

219
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,696
preferredFont(forTextStyle) API

220
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,906
to get a font for the text

221
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:59,296
style, and then you can use the

222
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:00,886
adjustsFontForContentSize

223
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:02,986
Category property to make sure

224
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:03,986
that your views update their

225
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:04,956
fonts if the text size changes.

226
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:12,496
But what if you can't use text

227
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:12,916
styles?

228
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,476
Maybe you have a design that

229
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:16,616
requires custom fonts.

230
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,676
The great news is that in iOS 11

231
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,796
it's really easy to get those

232
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,136
fonts to work well with Dynamic

233
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:23,956
Type.

234
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,676
So let's say you have some code

235
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:29,026
that assigns the font property

236
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,426
of a label to a custom font of

237
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:30,976
your choosing.

238
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,166
In iOS 11 you can now use the

239
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,106
new UIFontMetrics class to scale

240
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,395
that font so that it will get

241
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,316
smaller or bigger, depending on

242
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:42,976
the user's text size.

243
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,726
[ Applause ]

244
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:46,806
Thanks.

245
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:50,046
[ Applause ]

246
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:51,766
In this example we're using the

247
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,346
default font metrics, which

248
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:54,826
means we're using the font

249
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,346
metrics of the body text style.

250
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,626
That means that if body text

251
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:00,596
would be 50 percent larger for a

252
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:02,436
particular user, your font will

253
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:03,916
also get 50 percent larger.

254
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:07,256
For better results, you can pick

255
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,756
a particular text style that you

256
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,896
want to scale your font with.

257
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,766
So, for example, if you have a

258
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,286
font that you're using for title

259
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,906
text in your app, you might

260
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,466
choose to scale it in the same

261
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,696
way that we've scaled title1

262
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:17,976
text.

263
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,176
Now, a final word on web views.

264
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:26,906
Many of you may have web views

265
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:27,896
that you're displaying in your

266
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:29,096
iOS app.

267
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,586
You should make those adapt for

268
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:31,506
Dynamic Type as well.

269
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,776
To do so, you can use the

270
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:36,286
-apple-system-body font and that

271
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:37,786
will get you the body text style

272
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,636
font and it will adapt for the

273
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:41,056
user's dynamic typesetting.

274
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:44,186
Now, note that this is only

275
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,896
available on Apple devices, so

276
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:46,806
if you're planning to use the

277
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:47,866
same web page for other

278
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,716
platforms, make sure you set an

279
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:51,566
appropriate fallback font.

280
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:55,076
Then for your other styles you

281
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,626
can define their font sizes in

282
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,716
terms of relative units, and

283
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:58,536
that way they'll scale

284
00:09:58,536 --> 00:09:58,976
proportionately.

285
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,096
So that's how you can scale your

286
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,486
font sizes for Dynamic Type.

287
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,246
Now let's look at how you can

288
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:10,476
accommodate larger text in your

289
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:10,976
app layouts.

290
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,316
So let's say we've got some text

291
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:18,586
at the default text size, and

292
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,736
you can imagine that the white

293
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,766
border is the available area on

294
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:20,976
the screen.

295
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,086
So first step, let's scale the

296
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:25,626
font size.

297
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:29,846
We have a problem.

298
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,286
The text is now running off

299
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,406
screen and so your users are not

300
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,346
going to see anything outside of

301
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:36,066
the white box.

302
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,556
To prevent the label from

303
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,396
running off screen, we can add a

304
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:39,976
trailing constraint.

305
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,916
But now we still have a problem

306
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,886
because the text is getting

307
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:47,376
truncated.

308
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:48,966
The end result is that your

309
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,366
users aren't going to see all

310
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:50,646
the text.

311
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:53,676
To really fix this let's wrap

312
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:57,236
the text and that will allow the

313
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:58,696
text to grow as much as it needs

314
00:10:58,696 --> 00:10:59,506
while still displaying all of

315
00:10:59,506 --> 00:10:59,936
the text.

316
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:06,316
To wrap text in Interface

317
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,606
Builder you can use the

318
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,416
Attribute Inspector and adjust

319
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:10,816
the Lines property on your

320
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:11,146
label.

321
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:13,306
By default this is set to one

322
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,236
line, but if you change it to 0,

323
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,716
that will allow your label to

324
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:18,196
wrap to as many lines as it

325
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:19,436
needs for its content.

326
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,346
You can do the same thing in

327
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,286
code by setting the number of

328
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:24,946
lines property to 0.

329
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,586
Okay. Let's look at another

330
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,966
common scenario that can occur.

331
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:37,036
So when you're writing your app

332
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:37,886
and you're thinking about the

333
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:40,496
default text size, it's tempting

334
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,126
to use constant values for your

335
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:42,726
spacings.

336
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,366
So you might have something like

337
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,606
two labels here whose baselines

338
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,886
are separated by a constant 40

339
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:49,146
points.

340
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:52,526
Looks great at the default text

341
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,646
size, but once you start

342
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:56,856
adapting for Dynamic Type, you

343
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,116
can run into problems like this,

344
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,156
where the labels overlap.

345
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:03,766
What we really want here is a

346
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:04,736
spacing that's dynamic and that

347
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:05,976
accounts for the fonts involved.

348
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:13,376
In iOS 11 you can now do this

349
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:15,076
with new Auto Layout System

350
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:15,976
Spacing Constraints.

351
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,586
You can define the spacing

352
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:20,566
between two baselines and Auto

353
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:21,876
Layout will automatically figure

354
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,616
out the best spacing to use

355
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,036
based on the fonts of your

356
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:25,456
viewers.

357
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,816
Now, if you try this and you

358
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,486
decide that you want a slightly

359
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:32,256
larger or smaller spacing, you

360
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:34,146
can do that, too, by adjusting

361
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:36,706
the Multiplier property and that

362
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:37,686
will let you get the exact

363
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,046
results you want.

364
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:42,546
It's also possible to use these

365
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,356
new Auto Layout Constraints in

366
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:45,626
Interface Builder, and for more

367
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,096
information on that, please

368
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:48,226
check out the Auto Layout

369
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,066
Techniques and Interface Builder

370
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:49,976
talk that happened this morning.

371
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,316
Now, I know there are probably

372
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,966
some of you out there who have a

373
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:00,826
view in your app that was

374
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,546
written eight or nine years ago

375
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:03,806
and it's just not using Auto

376
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:04,886
Layout.

377
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,686
Don't worry, we have you

378
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,026
covered.

379
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,046
So let's say you have some

380
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:10,976
layout code that sets a constant

381
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:11,696
value and ads that to a y

382
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:11,976
origin.

383
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:17,476
Using the same UIFontMetrics

384
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,556
class we saw earlier we can

385
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:21,556
scale that 40 point value, or

386
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,616
any CGFloat value, and that way

387
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:25,886
it will get smaller or larger,

388
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:26,846
depending on the user's text

389
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:26,966
size.

390
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:34,516
Now let's look at one final

391
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,356
common scenario.

392
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,356
Here we've got two labels that

393
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:40,196
are side-by-side at the default

394
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:40,696
text size.

395
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:42,916
Again, you can imagine that the

396
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,406
yellow border is the area

397
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,336
available on screen.

398
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,226
Now let's scale our font sizes.

399
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:52,746
As you can see, there's not

400
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:53,756
enough room for the text

401
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,906
anymore, so going back to what

402
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:58,006
we saw earlier, we could try to

403
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:58,966
wrap the text --

404
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:04,736
and we'll get something like

405
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:05,156
this.

406
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:07,756
So I'd like to step back for a

407
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:09,626
second and revisit those three

408
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:10,486
goals we mentioned at the

409
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:11,216
beginning of the talk.

410
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:13,846
First, all text should be large

411
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:14,926
enough to read.

412
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:16,316
We've got that covered.

413
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,846
Second, all text should be fully

414
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:20,246
readable.

415
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,836
That's true here.

416
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,986
None of the text is missing.

417
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,286
Third, app UI should look

418
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,236
beautiful at all text sizes.

419
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:31,556
And that's where we haven't

420
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:32,506
quite met our goals yet.

421
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,366
As you can see, on the righthand

422
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,456
side the d is being orphaned

423
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,596
from the rest of the word and it

424
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:38,626
just doesn't look right.

425
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:42,476
So for this scenario we

426
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,026
recommend that for larger font

427
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,016
sizes you change your layout to

428
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,056
use vertical stacking and that

429
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,396
way each label can grow to the

430
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:51,676
full width of the screen.

431
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,306
Now, this technique works not

432
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,936
just for text, but for anything

433
00:14:57,936 --> 00:14:59,346
that might take room away from

434
00:14:59,346 --> 00:14:59,856
text.

435
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,106
For example, here's the Siri

436
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:04,176
Help screen and notice how on

437
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,296
the left, at the default text

438
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,326
size, there's an icon that takes

439
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:10,346
up a horizontal column away from

440
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:10,636
the text.

441
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,336
So that's why for larger font

442
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:14,936
sizes we actually move that icon

443
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,606
above the text and allow the

444
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:17,706
text to grow to the full width

445
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:17,976
of the screen.

446
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,786
Now, to do an alternate layout

447
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:26,086
based on the user's text size

448
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:27,316
you'll need to know how to get

449
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:27,426
that.

450
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:31,126
You can do that by accessing the

451
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:34,046
preferredConstantSizeCategory

452
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,166
property on either your view's

453
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,866
traitCollection or on the

454
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:39,966
UIApplication object.

455
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,356
The default text size will

456
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:46,246
return large and the standard

457
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,876
sizes run from extra small to

458
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,406
extra, extra, extra large.

459
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,606
The Accessibility sizes are

460
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,076
prefixed with Accessibility to

461
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:57,976
avoid adding more extras.

462
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:05,126
Now, in iOS 11 we've added new

463
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,376
functions that you can use to

464
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:07,676
ask questions about the user's

465
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,256
text size.

466
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:10,976
So, for example, you can check

467
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,136
whether the user is using one of

468
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:13,626
the Accessibility text sizes,

469
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,116
and if so, you can do an

470
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,326
alternate layout like vertical

471
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:16,706
stacking,

472
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,506
or you can use any threshold you

473
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:20,866
want.

474
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:22,746
We now support compares in

475
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,196
operators so you can check

476
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:25,636
whether the user's text size is

477
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:26,706
larger than a particular

478
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:26,976
threshold.

479
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:35,436
So that covers some general

480
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:36,616
guidelines for adapting your

481
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,316
layouts for Dynamic Type.

482
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,816
Now let's look at the specific

483
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:44,616
case of table views.

484
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:45,946
Earlier we saw how the Settings

485
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,516
app adapts beautifully for all

486
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:48,606
Dynamic Type sizes.

487
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,246
The good news is that if you're

488
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,456
using a standard table view

489
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,016
styles, you will get this kind

490
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:53,866
of layout for free.

491
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,166
So your fonts will grow or

492
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,526
shrink, depending on the Dynamic

493
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:59,316
Type setting, and for larger

494
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,436
fonts the text will wrap so that

495
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:04,705
all of it is visible.

496
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,066
Also, for standard table views

497
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,486
that have a detail text label,

498
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,656
those will automatically lay out

499
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,306
with vertical stacking for

500
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:12,746
larger fonts.

501
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,415
So standard table views will

502
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,596
adapt their layout for Dynamic

503
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:21,175
Type, and cell heights are based

504
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:21,906
on their content.

505
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,006
This is particularly important

506
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:25,556
at larger font sizes where the

507
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,636
text wraps because a cell that

508
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,116
has more text may need to be

509
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,066
taller than a cell that has

510
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:32,316
less.

511
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,026
So how do we accomplish variable

512
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:34,976
cell heights in a table view?

513
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:39,056
We can do this through a

514
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,346
technique called self-sizing.

515
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:43,346
When self-sizing is enabled, the

516
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:44,996
table view will ask each cell to

517
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,126
provide its own size and the

518
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,806
cell can calculate that based on

519
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,346
its own content.

520
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,196
Then the table view client

521
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:54,426
simply needs to give the table

522
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:55,736
view an estimate for any cells

523
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:56,836
that are off screen.

524
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:05,356
In iOS 11 self-sizing is enabled

525
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:06,026
by default.

526
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,226
However, if you're using fixed

527
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,496
row heights or if you are using

528
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:12,936
Interface Builder, you may need

529
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,206
to enable self-sizing.

530
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:17,846
To do so set your row height of

531
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,476
a table view to be Automatic

532
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,516
Dimension and then set the

533
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,166
Estimated Row Height to a

534
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,626
reasonable estimate given your

535
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:25,476
table view.

536
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:28,516
If you have section headers and

537
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,326
footers, you can do the same

538
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,556
thing for those using very

539
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,976
similarly named properties.

540
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:39,826
So that's the story for standard

541
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:40,486
table view cells.

542
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,616
Now, if you're using custom

543
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:44,526
cells with Auto Layout, it's

544
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,696
really easy to get these to work

545
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:46,366
with self-sizing.

546
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,436
All you need to do is set up

547
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,776
your constraints so that they

548
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:53,226
define the size of the cell and

549
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:54,906
then Auto Layout will figure out

550
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:55,686
the size for you.

551
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:57,996
So let's look at how we could

552
00:18:58,026 --> 00:18:59,366
set up the constraints for this

553
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,126
custom cell shown here, where we

554
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,766
have two labels, one on top of

555
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:02,966
the other.

556
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:06,906
We'll definitely want leading

557
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:08,046
and trailing constraints for

558
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:08,816
those labels.

559
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,026
And we want to make sure that

560
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,116
the labels are separated

561
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:15,086
vertically by an appropriate

562
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,006
amount of space.

563
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,186
Again, you can use the new

564
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:19,306
System Spacing Constraints to

565
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:20,836
get a value that will work well

566
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:21,896
at all text sizes.

567
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:23,976
So are we done?

568
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:27,696
Not quite.

569
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,296
We still need to add constraints

570
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:31,006
relative to the top and bottom

571
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,926
of the cell and that will

572
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,086
complete the set of constraints

573
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,516
we need to define the size of

574
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:35,886
the cell.

575
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,796
Again, you can use the System

576
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,216
Spacing Constraints here to get

577
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:41,036
values that will look good

578
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:41,946
across all text sizes.

579
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,236
Now, if you're using Manual

580
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,606
Layout with your cells, you can

581
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,766
also use self-sizing.

582
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,356
To do so you'll want to override

583
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,386
the sizeThatFits method on your

584
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:01,556
cell, and then you can use the

585
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,866
contentView's width to figure

586
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:04,726
out the width available for your

587
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:04,976
subviews.

588
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,676
Now let's move on to our last

589
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:15,856
topic, images.

590
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,926
Why are images showing up in a

591
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,936
talk about Dynamic Type?

592
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,226
After all, they're not text.

593
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,456
But images are an integral part

594
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,946
of your app's UI and in some

595
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,896
cases they carry meaning that's

596
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,266
not communicated elsewhere.

597
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,416
So for the same reason it's

598
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,036
important for your text to be

599
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:35,916
readable by your users, it's

600
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,436
also important that your images

601
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,276
are distinguishable.

602
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:40,636
Let's look at an example.

603
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:44,776
So here's the Recents view in

604
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,576
the phone app.

605
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,896
Notice how in front of some of

606
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:51,126
the calls there's an image of a

607
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,846
phone with an arrow pointing out

608
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:53,816
of it.

609
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,356
This image means that this call

610
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,856
was made by you versus a call

611
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:01,126
that came in.

612
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,636
Now let's turn up the text size.

613
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:06,386
For those of you who are

614
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:08,136
wondering, the image has moved

615
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,526
over here and notice how it is

616
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,166
tiny compared to the text.

617
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,766
If you need your text to be this

618
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,826
big so you can read it, you

619
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,126
probably can't see that image.

620
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:22,056
So what we really want to do

621
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,316
here is scale the image the same

622
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,746
way that we scale a text, and

623
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,526
that's exactly what we've done

624
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:29,696
in iOS 11, and better yet, we

625
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,226
made it easy for you to do so in

626
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:31,756
your own apps.

627
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:35,896
So to just allow your images to

628
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:37,986
scale for Dynamic Type you'll

629
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:39,626
first want to make sure that

630
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:40,886
your images are provided as

631
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,476
PDF's at 1x scale.

632
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,846
So this is a good idea anyways

633
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,146
because it allows you to use the

634
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:48,826
same image for both 2x and 3x

635
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:49,896
resolution devices.

636
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,216
In fact, your app might already

637
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:53,756
be doing this.

638
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:55,026
So just make sure you have a

639
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:55,116
PDF.

640
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:58,946
Next, go to the Asset Catalog

641
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,526
and check this new checkbox for

642
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:02,556
Preserving Vector Data.

643
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:05,696
If you don't check the checkbox,

644
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:07,126
when the Asset Catalog is

645
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,516
compiled, it's going to

646
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:10,396
rasterize all the PDF's.

647
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:12,856
But if you check the checkbox,

648
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:14,636
the original PDF gets preserved,

649
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:17,316
and the cool thing about that is

650
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,896
that now if you use this image

651
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:20,456
and put it into an image view of

652
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,576
any size, the image will get

653
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:23,826
drawn smoothly using PDF

654
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:23,976
Drawing.

[ Applause ]

656
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:34,436
Now, the final step is to make

657
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,996
sure that your view resizes for

658
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:36,596
Dynamic Type.

659
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,796
To do this in Interface Builder

660
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,846
you can select any image view or

661
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:44,226
button and you can check the new

662
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,056
Adjusts Image Size property.

663
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,076
This means that your image

664
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,356
viewer button will scale up for

665
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:52,806
the five largest Dynamic Type

666
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:53,266
sizes.

667
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,276
And you can do the same thing in

668
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,616
code with the Adjusts Image Size

669
00:22:59,866 --> 00:22:59,986
for

670
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:01,646
AccessibilityContentSizeCategory

671
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:01,946
property.

672
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,786
There's one more place where

673
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:11,586
image scaling comes in handy,

674
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:14,246
and that's when the user long

675
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:16,186
presses on a bar item.

676
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:18,366
So earlier we saw how you can

677
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,746
long press on the Voicemail tab

678
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,136
to show a larger version in the

679
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:21,876
middle of the screen.

680
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:23,936
Notice that both the text is

681
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,146
scaling and also the image.

682
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:26,406
So we want to make sure that

683
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,526
that image looks as good as

684
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:27,946
possible.

685
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,746
If your bar item is using a PDF

686
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,666
image, all you need to do is

687
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,946
check the Preserve Vector Data

688
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:39,656
checkbox that we saw earlier.

689
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:42,216
That will allow UIKit to scale

690
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:42,976
it up smoothly.

691
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:46,066
If you're not using a PDF,

692
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,236
you'll want to provide a larger

693
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:49,226
version that we can show when

694
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:50,856
the user long presses on that

695
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:51,146
image.

696
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:55,596
To do that in Interface Builder

697
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:56,896
you can go to the Attributes

698
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,726
Inspector and set the

699
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,206
Accessibility property of your

700
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,976
bar item to be the larger

701
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:02,886
version.

702
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:06,466
Or in code you can simply set

703
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:08,006
the largeContentSizeImage

704
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:08,976
property to that larger version.

705
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,246
So we've just covered a variety

706
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,616
of tips and tricks you can use

707
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:19,116
to adapt your apps for Dynamic

708
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:19,346
Type.

709
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,886
And now I'd like to invite

710
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:22,466
Nandini to the stage to show all

711
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:22,976
of that in a sample app.

Accessibility Team at Apple.

717
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,366
Today, using a sample app, I'll

718
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,176
show you how you can fix your

719
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,066
app in very little time with

720
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:43,386
[inaudible] font sizes.

721
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:46,366
First, I will open the app in

722
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,016
the default text size, and later

723
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:51,056
I'll open the app in the largest

724
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,286
of the Dynamic Type font size

725
00:24:52,286 --> 00:24:54,926
and fix issues along the way.

726
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,206
Let's start the app.

00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:56,626
We cleared it.

00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,676
It's called Cute Battle Pets.

729
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:00,256
In this app you can choose among

730
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:01,546
two pets to battle with each

731
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:01,716
other.

00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:06,116
Let me open the app now.

733
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:08,346
In this tab, Opponents, you see

734
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:10,096
a list of pets you can choose to

735
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,396
battle among each other, and the

736
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:14,716
next tab, Achievements, you see

737
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:16,666
a list of badges of honors these

738
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:17,586

00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,286
Start from the dropdown menu.

763
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:11,156
I'll go to the Settings tab in

764
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:12,576
the Accessibility Inspector.

765
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:15,376
Here you see a font size slider.

766
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,856
The font size is currently the

767
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:18,726
default text size.

768
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:20,766
I'm going to move the slider's

769
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,276
knob to the last notch on the

770
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:22,666
slider.

771
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,106
That is the largest of the

772
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:26,846
Dynamic Type font size.

773
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:29,276
Let's go back to our app now to

774
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:32,716
see the effect of this change.

775
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:34,516
The font size of these labels

776
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,396
has not changed yet.

777
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,576
Any idea why this is happening?

778
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:39,346
This is happening because of two

779
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:39,776
reasons.

780
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:42,416
The labels here are not yet set

781
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:44,956
to automatically adjust to the

782
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:46,706
user's ContentSizeCategory, and

783
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:49,456
the petName and petDescription

784
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:50,876
labels here are using custom

785
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:51,236
fonts.

786
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:53,986
Let's go to a project now to fix

787
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:54,486
these issues.

788
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:57,286
I'll minimize Accessibility

789
00:26:57,286 --> 00:26:58,196
Inspector for now.

790
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:03,206
I'll go to BattleCell zip file.

791
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:05,366
Here, using the jump bar, I'll

792
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:06,346
move to Set Up Labels and

793
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:07,336
Buttons Method.

794
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:12,976
Here for petName, petDescription

795
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:15,216
and battleButton's titleLabel,

796
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:17,526
I'll set the property at this

797
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:19,446
font for ContentSizeCategory and

798
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:19,976
I'll set it to True.

799
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,616
As petName and petDescription

800
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:32,766
are using custom fonts, we can

801
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:35,076
use UIFont, make it API, scan

802
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:36,246
font for font metric.

803
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:37,986
For petName I'll be using the

804
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:38,976
headline TextStyle.

805
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:45,316
For petDescription I'll be using

806
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:46,576
the sub headline TextStyle.

807
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,246
Let's run the app again and see

808
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:51,936
the effect of these changes.

809
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,636
Now, after these labels are

810
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:04,886
adjusted to the user's

811
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:07,276
ContentSizeCategory, we see that

812
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,736
these labels have really less

813
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:09,846
horizontal room to grow.

814
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,236
With the menu on the left and

815
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,106
the button on the right, these

816
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,686
labels have really less

817
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:17,576
horizontal room to grow and the

818
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,516
labels either truncate or wrap

819
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:21,226
in multiple lines.

820
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,776
We can fix this by having an

821
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,796
alternate adopt layout for

822
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:28,746
larger text constraints.

823
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:32,136
We can achieve this by moving

824
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:34,036
the image above the text and the

825
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,866
button below the text.

826
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:38,376
This will ensure that the labels

827
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:40,136
are less of wrap and truncated.

828
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,766
Let's go fix this in our project

829
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:41,916
now.

830
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:48,966
First, before adding this

831
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,246
adoptLayoutConstraints for

832
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,356
larger text constraints, let me

833
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,946
add a private variable for that.

834
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,756
Next let me go to

835
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:01,576
setupLayoutConstraints method.

836
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,916
Here you see that you already

837
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,426
have a set of layout constraints

838
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:07,596
for default text size.

839
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,066
Now I'll be placing a set of

840
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:11,446
constraints for larger Dynamic

841
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:11,976
Type font sizes.

842
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:19,736
These set of constraints pasted

843
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:20,896
here will be available in the

844
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,386
sample app code attached along

845
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,176
the session website.

846
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,366
You can go and review this after

847
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:27,216
the session, but I give a short

848
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,726
overview of what this actually

849
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:29,406
do.

850
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:32,636
These constraints ensure that

851
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:34,436
the image labels and the button

852
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:35,596
are vertically stacked, and

853
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,816
these constraints also get them

854
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:40,396
in the height of the cell.

855
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,106
Okay. Let's go to our

856
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:43,616
developerLayoutConstraints

857
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:43,936
method.

858
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:46,356
Here we see that one of the

859
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:48,046
developer constraints aren't

860
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,386
activated.

861
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:50,106
We need the larger [inaudible],

862
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:50,246
right.

863
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:50,976
Let's fix that.

864
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,176
Here, based on user's

865
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,676
preferredContentSizeCategory,

866
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:01,976
they put in the five largest

867
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:03,606
Dynamic Type font sizes.

868
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,746
With the app you will be able to

869
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:06,876
look at its constraints and

870
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:08,526
activateLargeTextConstraints.

871
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,496
Otherwise, do the reverse

872
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:11,086
operation.

873
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:14,956
To ensure that these layout

874
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:17,066
constraints are up-to-date based

875
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,056
on the change in trait

876
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:20,906
collection, we call this method

877
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,166
if trait collection did change.

878
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:27,746
If the user's

879
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:29,966
preferredContentSizeCategory

880
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,256
shifts from the five largest

881
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:33,156
Dynamic Type font sizes to the

882
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:34,586
smaller Dynamic Type font sizes,

883
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:37,016
or visa-versa, these layout

884
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:37,976
constraints will be updated.

885
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:41,226
Let's run the app again to see

886
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:41,956
the effect of these changes.

887
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,346
Great. After vertically stacking

888
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:55,396
the content the labels are less

889
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,256
of wrapped and there's no

890
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,006
truncation at all.

891
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,056
Let's go the next step,

892
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:00,926
Achievements.

893
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:04,806
When we run the app in the

894
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,526
default text size, you will

895
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,086
notice that these cells here

896
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,226
have multiple lines of text, but

897
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:12,166
currently only one line of text

898
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,056
is visible on screen.

899
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,646
Let's go to Achievements View

900
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,336
Controller in Swift check on why

901
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:17,976
this is happening.

902
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:22,266
This is happening because the

903
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:23,826
table view's row height is set

904
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:25,036
to a constant value, hundred.

905
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:27,426
This makes that these cells do

906
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:29,256
not have cell size at all.

907
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,766
To fix this and make this cells

908
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,156
have size we have to set the

909
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:35,976
table view's row height to use

910
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:37,756
UITableViewAutomaticDimension,

911
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,686
and TableView's

912
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:42,206
estimatedRowHeight to a constant

913
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,976
value, and I'll choose hundred.

914
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:49,916
Let's run the app again.

915
00:31:58,136 --> 00:31:59,846
Let me go to Achievements tab.

916
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:03,936
Now we see that we have more

917
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,426
lines of text in each of these

918
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:07,736
cells, and the cells, they're

919
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,696
sized to fit content, but let's

920
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:11,036
take a look at the [inaudible].

921
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:16,046
Unlike the labels the images do

922
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:17,106
not grow, according to the

923
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:18,186
user's ContentSizeCategory.

924
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:21,126
To fix this let's go to

925
00:32:21,126 --> 00:32:21,806
Achievements [inaudible] file.

926
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:29,376
And set the label and image view

927
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:29,976
method.

928
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:32,866
For the badgeImageView I set the

929
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:34,966
property adjustsImageSize for

930
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,106
accessibilityContentSize

931
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:37,936
Category, and I set it to two.

932
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,636
This will ensure that the image

933
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:42,096
is scaled for the five largest

934
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:42,976
Dynamic Type font sizes.

935
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,016
Let's run the app again to see

936
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:48,946
the effect of this change.

937
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,016
Let me move to Achievements tab.

938
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:02,896
Great. Both the labels and the

939
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,806
image have sizes largest Dynamic

940
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:08,156
Type font size, but let's take a

941
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:09,346
closer look at the image in

942
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:09,966
these cells.

943
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,156
Let's also take a look at the

944
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:19,236
large text only that comes up in

945
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:20,426
a long press on the tab bar

946
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:20,906
icons.

947
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:31,256
Based on that, the images in

948
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:33,306
these cells and also in the tab

949
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:35,386
bar icons were not smooth.

950
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,556
To fix that we have to go to

951
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:39,396
Assets Catalog, choose our

952
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:43,996
images, those are PDF images, go

953
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:49,636
to the Attributes Inspector and

954
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:53,596
click on the Preserve Vector

955
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,946
Data checkbox.

956
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:02,256
If we do this, what happens is

957
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,926
the PDF vector data is preserved

958
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:05,806
and the images are rendered

959
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:07,376
smooth in different Dynamic Type

960
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:07,926
font sizes.

961
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:10,396
Let's run the app again to see

962
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:10,936
the effect of this change.

963
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,576
Let me go to Achievements tab.

964
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:24,795
For confirmation, let me zoom in

965
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:24,946
again.

966
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,996
Now we see that the images here

967
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:36,846
are rendered smooth, right.

968
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:41,766
Finally, using the Accessibility

969
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,286
Inspector, I'm going to run

970
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:44,916
through a quick audit of this

971
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:46,926
app and different Dynamic Type

972
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:47,466
font sizes.

973
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,356
For that let me minimize Xcode.

974
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,126
Let me bring up the

975
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,976
Accessibility Inspector.

976
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,666
Let me move the first tab,

977
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,236
Opponents.

978
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:01,786
Let me switch the font size

979
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,086
slider to default text size.

980
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,496
Now I'm going to increase the

981
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,386
font size one-by-one and you'll

982
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:09,966
notice that the labels in these

983
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:11,436
cells increase according to the

984
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:12,696
user's ContentSizeCategory.

985
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:13,976
When I move to the five larger

986
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:16,246
Dynamic Type font sizes, the

987
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,766
layout of these cells change.

988
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,306
The labels have more horizontal

989
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:24,496
room to grow and the cell says

990
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:25,436
sizeToFitContent.

991
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:30,436
Next move on to Achievements to

992
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:31,466
do the same audit.

993
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:37,246
I'll switch back to default text

994
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:39,006
size.

995
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,496
I'll increase the font size

996
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:41,706
one-by-one.

997
00:35:42,736 --> 00:35:44,666
Now, you see that the labels

998
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:45,686
wrap in multiple lines.

999
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:48,186
The cell says sizeToFitContent,

1000
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:51,186
and also the image scales in the

1001
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:52,966
five larger Dynamic Type font

1002
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:53,806
sizes.

1003
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:56,226
So there you have it.

1004
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,376
Our app looks pretty great in

1005
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,386
all the Dynamic Type font sizes.

1006
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:03,606
So using the new API's available

1007
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:05,076
in iOS 11, you can make your

1008
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,366
apps, too, work for all Dynamic

1009
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,046
Type font sizes.

1010
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:09,546
Now I welcome Clare back on

1011
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:10,306
stage to conclude the

1012
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:10,756
presentation.

1013
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:10,946
Thank you.

1014
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:17,606
[ Applause ]

1015
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:19,366
>> Thanks, Nandini.

1016
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,666
So all of that sample code is

1017
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,186
available on our session

1018
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:26,436
website, but the version we have

1019
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,366
on the session website is

1020
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:28,676
actually expanded to include

1021
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:29,686
even more examples.

1022
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,706
So you can see how we do this in

1023
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:32,766
Interface Builder.

1024
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:34,396
You can see an example where we

1025
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:36,196
wrap text around images.

1026
00:36:36,556 --> 00:36:38,056
You can find a case where we

1027
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,376
allow scrolling only when

1028
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:41,296
necessary for larger fonts, and

1029
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:41,546
more.

1030
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:43,566
Think of it as a recipe book for

1031
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:44,816
things you might encounter in

1032
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:45,466
your own apps.

1033
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:47,376
So we highly encourage you to

1034
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:47,976
check it out after the session.

1035
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:53,506
To summarize what we covered

1036
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:55,556
today, it's easy to support

1037
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:57,836
Dynamic Type with new API in iOS

1038
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:58,126
11.

1039
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,526
If you have an app that doesn't

1040
00:37:00,526 --> 00:37:02,376
support Dynamic Type, now is a

1041
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,196
great time to do so, and you

1042
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:06,456
should because supporting

1043
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,046
Dynamic Type is good for your

1044
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:08,666
users.

1045
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:10,716
It's good for the users who

1046
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:12,616
prefer smaller text because it

1047
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:13,726
allows them to see more on

1048
00:37:13,726 --> 00:37:14,126
screen.

1049
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:15,996
It's good for the users who

1050
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,576
prefer larger text because it's

1051
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:19,886
more comfortable to read, and

1052
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:21,826
it's especially beneficial for

1053
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:23,846
users who need larger text in

1054
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:26,286
order to be able to read it.

1055
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:29,226
When more apps are usable by

1056
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,766
people with a disability, such

1057
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:33,116
as low vision, it really helps

1058
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,006
to level the playing field for

1059
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:35,796
those users.

1060
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:37,836
And so by supporting Dynamic

1061
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:39,306
Type in your app, you're

1062
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:40,256
actually making the world a

1063
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:40,736
better place.

1064
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,356
So we really hope you take what

1065
00:37:43,356 --> 00:37:45,126
you saw today in today's session

1066
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:47,376
and go back and make apps that

1067
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:48,976
work well with Dynamic Type and

1068
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:50,606
include more users so that more

1069
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:51,606
users can benefit from the great

1070
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:51,976
work you've done.

1071
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:58,406
For more information, including

1072
00:37:58,406 --> 00:37:59,386
the sample code we showed,

1073
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:00,746
please go to our session

1074
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:00,976
website.

1075
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:05,476
Now, there have been several

1076
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:06,916
sessions at this conference

1077
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,146
related to the one we just gave.

1078
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,076
As we mentioned earlier, the

1079
00:38:10,076 --> 00:38:11,426
Design for Everyone talk from

1080
00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:13,086
yesterday covers the design

1081
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,646
thinking behind the iOS 11

1082
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:15,886
Dynamic Type improvements.

1083
00:38:16,536 --> 00:38:18,056
There are also two sessions on

1084
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:19,556
accessibility, What's New in

1085
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:21,406
Accessibility and Media and

1086
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:22,406
Gaming Accessibility.

1087
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:24,546
Both of these sessions cover how

1088
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:26,126
you can widen your user base and

1089
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:27,196
include more users.

1090
00:38:28,296 --> 00:38:30,296
And finally, as we mentioned

1091
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,926
earlier, to learn more about the

1092
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,486
System Spacing Constraints in

1093
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:35,116
Interface Builder, check out the

1094
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,226
Auto Layout Techniques in

1095
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:37,226
Interface Builder talk.

1096
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:38,706
Thank you all for coming, and I

1097
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:39,416
hope you enjoy the rest of the

1098
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:39,956
conference.
