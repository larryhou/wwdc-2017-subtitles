00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:23,306
>> Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:24,816
My name is Neil Desai, and I'm a

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,236
WatchKit Frameworks Engineer,

4
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:28,506
and I'm really excited to talk

5
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,166
about the life of a watchOS app

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:30,436
today.

7
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,086
So, watch apps have a phenomenal

8
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:37,316
capacity to be simple yet

9
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,626
incredibly powerful.

10
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:40,926
Well-designed watch apps have

11
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:43,036
the potential to be the ultimate

12
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:44,786
companion on your user's wrist.

13
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:47,926
Now, let's imagine your user for

14
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:48,376
a second.

15
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,366
What are they asking for when

16
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:51,736
they want to use your watch app?

17
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:53,626
Maybe they want to quickly

18
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,316
glance at some information, or

19
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:56,526
complete a simple task.

20
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,916
We think about great watch apps

21
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,406
that are designed to help your

22
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:02,646
user accomplish their goals in a

23
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,906
simple, quick way so that the

24
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:06,726
technology disappears and the

25
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,946
user can go about their day and

26
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:11,196
have an enhanced experience, all

27
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,486
because of your app.

28
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:16,706
So, today we're going to design

29
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:18,356
an app that I've been working on

30
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:19,266
in watchOS 3.

31
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:21,336
We're not ready to ship it just

32
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:23,046
yet, but we'll get to take

33
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,396
advantage of some of the new

34
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:26,676
capabilities and enhancements in

35
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,796
watchOS 4 to take our app to the

36
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,146
next level.

37
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:32,786
Today, we're going to talk

38
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,536
through four different additions

39
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,806
in watchOS 4 that can help

40
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:37,606
design our app.

41
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,506
We're going to talk about some

42
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,446
new things, such as our new

43
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,076
Unified Process Runtime.

44
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,896
We're going to get some great

45
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,296
performance improvements in our

46
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:49,486
app, and I'm going to show you

47
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,226
how to do so in watchOS 4.

48
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:54,866
We're going to talk through our

49
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,376
new Frontmost App State.

50
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:57,996
We're going to take advantage of

51
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,156
this state and build an amazing

52
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:01,526
experience for our user.

53
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,646
Also, we're going to talk about

54
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:07,166
some new improvements we've made

55
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,246
to Background App Refresh, and

56
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,596
how we can take advantage of

57
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:10,886
them.

58
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,786
And lastly, we're going to talk

59
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,506
about some new background modes

60
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,836
that are available in watchOS 4,

61
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,216
and take advantage of one of

62
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,036
them in our app.

63
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:24,336
So, let's get started and dive

64
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,716
right into our new Unified

65
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:27,736
Process Runtime.

66
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:29,886
So, we've designed a

67
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:31,596
single-process architecture that

68
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,276
will help your apps become even

69
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:35,166
faster and more responsive to

70
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:35,906
your user.

71
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,516
So, let's now just revisit some

72
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,796
of the history of where we came

73
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:41,056
from and where we're now at,

74
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:41,426
today.

75
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,996
So in watchOS 3, your apps UI

76
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:47,806
lived in the app process, which

77
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,556
we managed for you, and your

78
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,456
code lived in the watch

79
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:53,206
extension, so we had two

80
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,716
separate processes, in this

81
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,076
case, that lived on the system.

82
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,296
So, we changed things internally

83
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,206
and unified our process runtime,

84
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:04,646
so now the UI and your extension

85
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,646
code all get executed from the

86
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,596
same process.

87
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,926
And now, you might be wondering,

88
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:13,266
why exactly did we do this?

89
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,496
So ultimately, we wanted to

90
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,156
improve the performance of all

91
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,526
WatchKit apps on watchOS 4, so

92
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,356
users could have an even better

93
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:22,596
experience with your apps.

94
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,326
And, I'm really happy to say,

95
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:26,906
we've accomplished our goals.

96
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,556
We can see touch latency

97
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:30,946
improvements of almost up to

98
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:33,416
twice as fast in some cases.

99
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,546
So, from the moment a user

100
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,126
actually touches the screen, to

101
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:38,956
when your code gets called into,

102
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,436
we've seen a dramatic

103
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:41,076
improvement.

104
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,026
Also, for example, we've seen

105
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,376
dramatic frames-per-second

106
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,116
improvements when tied to

107
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,676
general pan gestures, and we

108
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,156
expect launch performance to

109
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:51,986
also improve.

110
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:55,066
And now, since we just have one

111
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,376
process to manage your UI and

112
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,236
your extension code, we now have

113
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,976
upped the memory limits to

114
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,726
account for this.

115
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:03,996
And, you might be wondering,

116
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:04,966
there's a lot of architecture

117
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,036
that we did internally, so what

118
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:08,346
do you all have to do to change

119
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,656
your apps to adopt this new

120
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:11,306
mechanism?

121
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,376
And, the great thing is that

122
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:14,646
there are actually no changes

123
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:15,606
required at all.

124
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:18,466
So, you'll be happy to hear that

125
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,366
all existing native WatchKit

126
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,236
extensions in the App Store

127
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,776
today will get this behavior as

128
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,226
soon as your user upgrades to

129
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,116
watchOS 4.

130
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,686
This new Unified Process Runtime

131
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,986
is completely backwards

132
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:31,606
compatible.

133
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,286
As long as your app is built

134
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,336
with watchOS 2 or later, you

135
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,006
don't have to anything else.

136
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,816
So, this means the app we're

137
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,016
going to improve today doesn't

138
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,126
need to change in Xcode, or on

139
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:45,836
the App Store.

140
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:47,426
It just works.

141
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,946
So now, let's talk about our new

142
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,036
Frontmost App State.

143
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,206
On the watch, a user many times

144
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,516
uses an app in a matter of

145
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,666
seconds, and then they put their

146
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,446
wrist down and expect the app to

147
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,456
finish up whatever task needs to

148
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:04,066
be finished.

149
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,096
Many times, a user wants to

150
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:08,796
raise their wrist again and see

151
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,516
your app has finished doing

152
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:12,626
whatever it needs to, and they

153
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,406
want it to feel like magic.

154
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,396
And, users shouldn't have to

155
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:17,606
keep their wrist up, for your

156
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:18,556
app to have to finish doing

157
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,736
whatever task it needs to

158
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,466
finish, and this is a really

159
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,196
common pain point for our users.

160
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,806
So, we thought a lot about all

161
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,006
the different ways we could give

162
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,246
you all more runtime to help

163
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,216
finish your tasks for your user,

164
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:35,246
and today, we're introducing a

165
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:36,926
collection of new capabilities

166
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,926
we call the Frontmost App State

167
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,976
to help you design experiences

168
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:41,866
for this case.

169
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,456
So, without further ado, let's

170
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:47,276
talk about our app.

171
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:51,436
So, the app is called Apple Pie

172
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,376
Me, and let's see how it looks.

173
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,906
So, it's a food delivery service

174
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,196
where you can get apple pies

175
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,206
delivered wherever you are, so

176
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:00,256
an apple pie a day keeps the

177
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,146
doctor away, right?

178
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,976
I think so, at least, I really

179
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,866
hope so, because I eat an apple

180
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,736
pie every single day, and

181
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:08,656
they're delicious.

182
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,106
And, I'm pretty busy, and I

183
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,146
always just want to quickly

184
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,476
order my apple pie, and get it

185
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:15,686
delivered wherever I am.

186
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,316
And, most importantly, I want to

187
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,016
tap the order button and then

188
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,706
simply put my wrist down and go

189
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:22,426
about my day.

190
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:24,986
In watchOS 3, it was a bit

191
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,506
difficult to build a perfect

192
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:28,966
experience, but with watchOS 4,

193
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:30,286
I'm going to show you how to

194
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:32,166
surprise and delight your users

195
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:33,806
using our new Frontmost App

196
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:34,146
State.

197
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,946
So, to help explain the

198
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,676
Frontmost App State, we're going

199
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:41,386
to talk through what exactly

200
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:42,786
application state means on the

201
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,846
watch, what does the term

202
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,986
frontmost mean, the enhanced

203
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,176
capabilities that you're going

204
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,386
to receive, and lastly, we're

205
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,146
going to walk through

206
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:52,676
architecting our Apple Pie Me

207
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:52,906
app.

208
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:56,876
So, let's say our user decides

209
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:57,606
to launch our app.

210
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,286
So here, the app is foreground,

211
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,786
the screen is on, and the

212
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,486
application state, in this case,

213
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:04,136
is active.

214
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,616
So now, let's say our user

215
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:08,056
decided to go back to the watch

216
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:08,396
face.

217
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,946
So, in this case, the app is

218
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:14,356
actually in the background and,

219
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:15,936
for instance, your application

220
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,816
might be running for a

221
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,096
complication update, for

222
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:18,506
example.

223
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,246
And now, let's say our user

224
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,606
decides to go back to our app.

225
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:25,256
So, we're active in foreground

226
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:27,166
again, and now the user's using

227
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,726
the app, but then they decide

228
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:29,586
they want to put their wrist

229
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:29,896
down.

230
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,256
So, the screen turns off, and

231
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:33,986
your app is no longer foreground

232
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:35,396
because of this.

233
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,776
However, since your app was the

234
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,246
last thing used, it's the

235
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,996
frontmost app, so when the user

236
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:43,736
raises their wrist again, your

237
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,166
app will be what they see,

238
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:46,926
instead of the watch face.

239
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,156
During this time, we think of

240
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:51,726
your app as the frontmost app.

241
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,476
So now, when your app is

242
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:55,996
frontmost in this way, the

243
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,816
application state will be

244
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:00,116
background, and you might be

245
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:02,366
wondering how exactly, or how

246
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,066
long does the app stay frontmost

247
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:04,296
for?

248
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,296
So, it's going to be two minutes

249
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,236
for all apps.

250
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,836
However, if there is an

251
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:13,146
expectation by your user to see

252
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:14,966
your app next when they raise

253
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,356
their wrist, then you can use a

254
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,716
new API to extend this timeout

255
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:20,006
to be eight minutes.

256
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:22,836
So, for example, if you're a

257
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,186
ride-sharing app in the middle

258
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:26,086
of a ride, then you might want

259
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:27,406
additional time in the frontmost

260
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,526
state, because there's a

261
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:30,406
reasonable expectation that the

262
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,116
user wants to see your app the

263
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:33,135
next time they raise their

264
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:33,546
wrist.

265
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:37,035
However, in many cases, if you

266
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,966
forget to turn this off when

267
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,176
it's not needed, you can

268
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:42,186
unwittingly annoy your user and

269
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:43,226
leave them with a subpar

270
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,015
experience.

271
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,196
So, always just make sure to

272
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,046
turn it off, to reset the time

273
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,896
back to two minutes when you no

274
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,156
longer need this experience.

275
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,626
So, let's jump into code to see

276
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:56,086
how we might enable the extended

277
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:56,476
timeout.

278
00:08:58,726 --> 00:08:59,996
So, it's really simple.

279
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,456
It's a Boolean property on our

280
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:03,196
WKExtension, and when we want

281
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,456
eight minutes, we can set it to

282
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,246
be true, and when we want to go

283
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,416
back to the default of two

284
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,626
minutes, we just set it to be

285
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:09,066
false.

286
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,706
So, there's one other point I

287
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:14,666
wanted to mention.

288
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,816
If the user raises their wrist

289
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,306
and views your app, then the

290
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,916
timeout is reset, regardless if,

291
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,266
if you use the frontmost

292
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,666
extended API or not.

293
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,556
Essentially, if the user is

294
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:29,116
still interested in using your

295
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,526
app, your app will stay

296
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:31,226
frontmost.

297
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,376
So, now we know what frontmost

298
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,926
means, but what does this all

299
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:38,656
really mean?

300
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,026
Like, what exactly does this new

301
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:40,786
state give us?

302
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:42,736
Well, we're going to get some

303
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:43,956
enhanced capabilities.

304
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:47,376
So, we're going to change the

305
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:48,676
notion of how we get our

306
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,336
WatchConnectivity resumes, and

307
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:51,976
our NSURLSession resumes.

308
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:53,136
So, our transfer and

309
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,996
connectivity is now improved.

310
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,456
We'll also change a little bit

311
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:58,976
about our task completions.

312
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:00,516
>> And then, we're also going to

313
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,866
allow haptics to be played in

314
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:02,896
this frontmost state.

315
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,946
And lastly, we're going to get a

316
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,526
frontmost notification, so we

317
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,786
can handle this via the user

318
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:10,426
notifications framework, and

319
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,736
choose the right experience.

320
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:14,566
So, let's dive right in.

321
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:18,266
So, for WatchConnectivity, we've

322
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,896
changed the way our background

323
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:22,116
transfers work, so when you use

324
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,926
on the phone, update application

325
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:26,296
context, transfer user info, or

326
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,466
transfer file, the request, when

327
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:29,706
you send it from the phone to

328
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,516
the watch, it'll just go right

329
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,336
through, wake up your app on the

330
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:35,036
watch, and then just deliver

331
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:35,686
your payload.

332
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,456
And, there's one point I wanted

333
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,846
to mention in relation to

334
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,696
WatchConnectivity, is that send

335
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,266
message won't work when you're

336
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,896
frontmost, but the screen's off,

337
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,396
because your application state

338
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,046
is background.

339
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:50,376
So, just always make sure that

340
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:52,146
call is reachable first, and

341
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,266
then that can allow you to send

342
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:53,826
the message.

343
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,756
And, along the same vein as

344
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,696
WatchConnectivity, we're also

345
00:10:58,696 --> 00:10:59,856
going to change the notion of

346
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:01,846
our resumes for NSURLSession.

347
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,816
So, when we have a background

348
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,726
download, for instance, and the

349
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:07,336
system's downloading it for us,

350
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:09,136
and then when the system is

351
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:09,986
finished, it's going to

352
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,886
automatically wake up our app,

353
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,176
if we're in the frontmost state,

354
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,116
and deliver the data right to

355
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,706
our application.

356
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:19,396
And, of course, with

357
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,796
NSURLSession, there is actually

358
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:21,936
two major parts.

359
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,476
There is the resume, when the

360
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,446
system has actually completed

361
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:26,766
downloading whatever it is you

362
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,336
need, but then there's also the

363
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,386
initiation of a download in the

364
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:30,936
background.

365
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,246
So, in most cases, this will

366
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:36,566
occur immediately, also, and in

367
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,066
very rare cases, it could get

368
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,726
delayed up to 10 minutes, but

369
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:42,296
it's a very rare situation.

370
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,566
If you've ever used

371
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,586
NSURLSession, which probably

372
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,316
almost everyone has here, for a

373
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:49,936
background transfer, this is a

374
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,476
really big deal on the frontmost

375
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:51,766
state.

376
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,726
To reliably depend on the

377
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:57,866
initiation and the resume of our

378
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,966
connectivity is really going to

379
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,366
change the design landscape for

380
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,126
the watch, and also, in

381
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:03,816
addition, with our

382
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:05,226
WatchConnectivity and getting

383
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,436
requests right from our phone.

384
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:12,826
So, another thing is, a lot of

385
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:13,816
times, a user might put their

386
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,586
wrist down, and in that moment,

387
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:17,296
your application goes into the

388
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,966
background, but you might need

389
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,086
to finish up a task.

390
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:22,186
So, say you need to close a

391
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:23,766
database, or do something else.

392
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,286
So, you can just use the

393
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,326
NSProcessInfo class to perform

394
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:31,006
expiring activity API to get up

395
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:32,766
to 30 seconds when foreground

396
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:34,956
initiated, and up to 10 seconds

397
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,146
when background initiated.

398
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,706
So, for example, for background

399
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:40,266
initiated, maybe you're running

400
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,246
in a complication for an update,

401
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:43,606
and you just need a little extra

402
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:45,036
time to get done.

403
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,656
So, you can just use the

404
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:48,896
NSProcessInfo class to get some

405
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:49,676
additional time.

406
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:52,826
And now, when you're frontmost,

407
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:55,236
and you use that API, then

408
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:57,856
you'll get increased priority by

409
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:58,506
the system.

410
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,806
So, because the system believes

411
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,706
that your app is more important

412
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:04,026
to the user, because it's still

413
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:05,566
in the frontmost state, the

414
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,196
priority by the system will get

415
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,126
increased, so you're more likely

416
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,746
to get the runtime that you need

417
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:12,426
to finish up whatever task you

418
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,696
need to do for your user.

419
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:18,126
And, another benefit of being

420
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:20,126
frontmost is, you can now play

421
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:21,946
haptics, so when you have

422
00:13:21,946 --> 00:13:23,596
runtime for another reason, you

423
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,976
can easily just play a haptic.

424
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:26,396
Thank you.

425
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,766
[ Applause ]

426
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,836
>> So, sometimes haptics can get

427
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:33,196
a little confusing here or

428
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,386
there, so let me just dive in

429
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:38,436
and talk to you about, so if

430
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:39,986
haptics, if you play a haptic,

431
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,956
and let's say some audio is

432
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,096
playing out a speaker, then only

433
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,346
the audio from a haptic will

434
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:46,976
play, and it ducks what's

435
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:47,726
currently playing.

436
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:49,936
If audio is playing out of

437
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,536
Bluetooth headphones and the

438
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,376
screen is on, then the haptics

439
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,166
will play, and if the screen is

440
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,606
off, then just the audio will

441
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:58,056
play, because that makes the

442
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,096
most sense for your user.

443
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,456
And so lastly, the other benefit

444
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,276
of being frontmost is, when you

445
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:07,726
receive a remote or local

446
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:09,466
notification via the user

447
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,186
notifications framework, you'll

448
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:13,136
then get called into, and then

449
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,296
you can decide the right

450
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,556
experience for your user.

451
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,416
So, maybe you want to just

452
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,126
update your UI, and play the

453
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,746
notification like normally, you

454
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,216
can have that choice, now.

455
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,666
And so, you'll get called into,

456
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,606
when you just override the

457
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,266
function userNotification

458
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:29,996
willPresent notification

459
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,066
withCompletionHandler.

460
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:34,446
And, the key of all these

461
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,656
benefits, and this can really

462
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,566
change the design landscape, but

463
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,916
the best part about all this is

464
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,976
it's free, so if your app gets a

465
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,156
WatchConnectivity or

466
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,556
NSURLSession resume, your app

467
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,026
will now get additional runtime.

468
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:50,906
If your app implements the

469
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:52,096
willPresent notification

470
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,756
callback, you'll now get that

471
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,356
for free in the frontmost state.

472
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,046
Also, if, for example, you want

473
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,696
to use a NSProcessInfo

474
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:02,386
performExpiringActivity API to

475
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:03,436
complete a task on

476
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,196
applicationWillEnterBackground,

477
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:06,466
you'll get some additional

478
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:07,536
priority by the system.

479
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,126
You can change nothing in

480
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,066
watchOS 4, and your current,

481
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,836
native application will

482
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,946
automatically be more glanceable

483
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:17,636
and actionable by default.

484
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,766
And, with the Unified Process

485
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:21,176
Runtime we talked about earlier,

486
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:22,916
your application will be even

487
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:23,756
more responsive.

488
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,036
But, we want you all to take it

489
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:27,856
a step further.

490
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:30,476
Your apps can now leap forward

491
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,096
in functionality if you take

492
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,306
these new behaviors into

493
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:33,766
account.

494
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,586
You need to architect your apps

495
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:37,846
for this experience.

496
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:41,116
So now, let's talk through the

497
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:42,526
Apple Pie Me app, and get

498
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,016
started architecting our app

499
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,496
using these new capabilities.

500
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,706
So, let's revisit some of the

501
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:49,656
design goals for the app from

502
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,956
the perspective of our user.

503
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:55,186
So, here we are at a timeline of

504
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,886
our user, and really, the user

505
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,306
just wants to order apple pie,

506
00:15:58,676 --> 00:15:59,976
and then they want to eat apple

507
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:02,106
pie, and sometimes in between,

508
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:02,866
they just want to view the

509
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:03,896
status of their order.

510
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:05,786
So, it's a pretty simple app

511
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:06,956
from the user's perspective.

512
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:08,766
But now, let's break down the

513
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,066
problem from our app's

514
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:10,726
perspective.

515
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,696
So, when that Order button is

516
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:15,886
pressed, then we're going to

517
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,316
send that order to our server,

518
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,376
and eventually, when the

519
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:21,026
restaurant has received the

520
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:23,796
request properly, and we know

521
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:24,836
that the pie is cooking, we're

522
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:25,486
going to send a push

523
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,186
notification.

524
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:27,906
And then, we also want to tell

525
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,356
our user when a courier is on

526
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,626
the way, and when a courier is

527
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:33,066
outside.

528
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,596
So, let's break this down some

529
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:38,936
more, and take it step by step.

530
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,826
So, we're at the Receive Order,

531
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:43,006
and how exactly do we do this?

532
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,226
Once the user taps the Order

533
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:46,936
button, what exactly should we

534
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:47,396
show?

535
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:49,556
We're going to be sending the

536
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:50,666
order to our server here, and

537
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,376
can't guarantee it'll come back

538
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:53,636
immediately, no matter what.

539
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,736
And, do we show something like

540
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,446
this, maybe a Loading indicator?

541
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,656
So, sometimes Loading indicators

542
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,456
do make sense to your user, but

543
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,156
in this case, it's actually

544
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,165
pretty confusing.

545
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,906
I might see this, and I might

546
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,665
think, "Oh, I need to hold my

547
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:09,646
wrist up.

548
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,006
How long do I have to hold my

549
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:11,486
wrist up?"

550
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:13,106
This isn't really a great

551
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:14,246
experience on the watch.

552
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:16,915
But instead, we could actually

553
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,046
show something like this.

554
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,016
So, hey, we'll tap you when the

555
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:20,726
pie's ready.

556
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,376
So, the user knows they can just

557
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,086
drop their wrist and go about

558
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,685
their day.

559
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,776
So, now we know at the Receive

560
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,896
Order screen, we know we just

561
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:31,926
want to show this new UI

562
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,196
immediately, so now let's break

563
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,266
this down into its separate

564
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:36,886
components.

565
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:40,646
So, we want to use NSURLSession

566
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:41,816
and post the order to our

567
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,176
server, and we also want to

568
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,966
extend the timeout, and then

569
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:46,796
just update our UI.

570
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:50,346
And lastly, there are times when

571
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:51,866
our server might not be

572
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,486
responsive, or something could

573
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,466
have gone wrong, and we need to

574
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:57,926
handle that case.

575
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,356
So, we need a mechanism that

576
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:01,956
allows us to schedule something

577
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,706
around, let's say, five minutes

578
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:04,046
from now.

579
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:06,166
And, we also need something that

580
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,936
doesn't depend on the network,

581
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:10,196
or something that, regardless of

582
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,166
frontmost or not, should alert

583
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:12,676
our user.

584
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,926
We also need something that we

585
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:18,826
can cancel later on, and so, if

586
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:19,716
you're thinking about a local

587
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:20,816
notification, then you'd be

588
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:21,746
absolutely right.

589
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:23,656
So, we could just show a local

590
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:25,036
notification that says, "Oh no!

591
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:26,096
Something went wrong."

592
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,626
And then, the user can easily

593
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,076
just tap on the Reorder button

594
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,006
and get another apple pie, or

595
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,326
they could just tap on the App

596
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,966
icon and go into the app and see

597
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:35,566
what went wrong.

598
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,226
So, let's just add that last

599
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:41,836
step, and now, let's just jump

600
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:43,726
into some code and see how this

601
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:46,846
can be done.

602
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:48,746
So, here we are at our IBAction

603
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:49,926
for when the Order button is

604
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:51,766
actually pressed, and then we

605
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:52,986
just want to grab our background

606
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:54,276
session, and then we're going to

607
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:55,566
want to post the order to our

608
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,056
server.

609
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:57,836
And then, because there's a

610
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,366
reasonable expectation that the

611
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,086
user wants to see our app the

612
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:02,386
next time, because they just

613
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,166
pressed the Order button, then

614
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,396
we're just going to extend our

615
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:06,266
frontmost timeout.

616
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,446
And then, we're going to trigger

617
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,596
that just-in-case scenario, our

618
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:13,456
fallback local notification, and

619
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,416
then we're just going to want to

620
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,376
reload some new UI.

621
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:20,556
Great. So now, we've received

622
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:22,096
the order, and eventually we're

623
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:22,796
going to send a push

624
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,596
notification for when the pie is

625
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:24,976
cooking.

626
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,896
So now, let's say our user puts

627
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,656
their wrist down sometime after

628
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:30,986
we've received the order.

629
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:35,066
So, right before we send that

630
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,236
notification, we expect to be in

631
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:39,616
the Frontmost App State, but

632
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:41,766
really, we, the developer, we

633
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:42,766
don't really need to know too

634
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,556
much about when the user puts

635
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:45,786
their wrist down, or raises it

636
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:46,236
up.

637
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,786
The next event that's really

638
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,886
just important is our push

639
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,366
notification, to just alert our

640
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,796
user that their pie is cooking.

641
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:55,216
If the app is frontmost, we'll

642
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:56,696
get our willPresent notification

643
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,026
callback we talked about

644
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:58,416
earlier.

645
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:00,786
Otherwise, if we're not

646
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,666
frontmost, the user just gets a

647
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,936
notification like normally.

648
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,236
And so, let's jump back into

649
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,796
some code and see what we can

650
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:07,966
do.

651
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,736
So, here we're just going to

652
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:13,356
override our user notification

653
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:15,296
center, willPresent notification

654
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:16,496
withCompletionHandler.

655
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:17,906
And then, the first thing we

656
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:19,636
want to do is, we just want to

657
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,716
make sure that we cancel our

658
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:22,846
local notification.

659
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:24,936
And then, we just want to reload

660
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:27,156
our new UI, and then, because we

661
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,036
did that, we want to just tap

662
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,256
our user, so they know to raise

663
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:30,766
their wrist.

664
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:32,756
And lastly, we want to call the

665
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,196
completionHandler and finish up.

666
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,086
And, I wanted to point out for

667
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,716
the completionHandler, it

668
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,376
actually takes a UNNotification

669
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,136
PresentationOptions, and so

670
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:43,856
that's the options of alert,

671
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:44,756
badge, or sound.

672
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,376
And, in this particular case, we

673
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,536
actually don't want a

674
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:50,486
notification to appear on top of

675
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,046
our app, because we've already

676
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,776
tapped the user, and we've

677
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:56,016
updated our UI, so instead,

678
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:56,836
we're just calling

679
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:57,946
completionHandler with none of

680
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,456
the options, so essentially

681
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,576
we're just going to be consuming

682
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,436
the notification, and then,

683
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,256
because the tap comes in, the

684
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:05,326
user would raise their wrist.

685
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,586
So, we just tap the user, and

686
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,736
they might see something such as

687
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:13,206
the following.

688
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,816
So, great, their pie is coming.

689
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,066
It's about 12 minutes away.

690
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:22,256
It's cooking in the oven.

691
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,966
So, here's where we were, and

692
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:24,856
now let's go back to our

693
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:25,396
timeline.

694
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,026
So, now we know our pie's

695
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:29,096
cooking at the restaurant.

696
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,406
And now, let's say we want the

697
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,326
user to be able to raise their

698
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,896
wrist and see as up to date of

699
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:35,996
an ETA as possible.

700
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,406
So, as soon as the user raises

701
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:39,946
their wrist, we will, of course,

702
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:41,686
ask for the most up-to-date ETA,

703
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:44,316
and this means that the next

704
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:45,516
time the user raises their wrist

705
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:48,206
again, we'd expect them to see

706
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,516
that up-to-date ETA.

707
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,036
Great. So, we handled our push

708
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:54,846
notification.

709
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,336
We now have a mechanism for

710
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:59,196
updating our ETAs, and now we

711
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:00,136
just want to send a push

712
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,706
notification again for when the

713
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:02,596
courier is on the way.

714
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,536
And, if we receive this push in

715
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:07,766
willPresent, then we're just

716
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:10,146
going to tap our user again, and

717
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,526
then maybe we might want to add

718
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:13,416
a map and an updated ETA showing

719
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,666
either where we are, or where

720
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,596
the courier is.

721
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,466
And, let's say, after we sent a

722
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,236
push notification for our

723
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:22,706
courier is on the way, the user

724
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,416
decides to maybe raise their

725
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:24,746
wrist.

726
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:27,026
So now, the user would see the

727
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,586
map and where their courier is,

728
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,096
and the app would provide a

729
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,926
great, glanceable experience.

730
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:34,206
And next, we can just send

731
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:35,976
another push for when our

732
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:36,806
courier is outside.

733
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,096
And then, if we're still in the

734
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:41,766
frontmost state, we can easily

735
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,276
just play another haptic like

736
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:45,356
before, and update our UI to

737
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:46,416
show that the courier is right

738
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:46,906
outside.

739
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,836
And, at this point, let's just

740
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:50,966
make sure to disable our

741
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,586
frontmost timeout extended API,

742
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,086
since we expect our user to be

743
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:57,006
eating apple pie now, instead of

744
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,626
actually just using our app.

745
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:00,996
So, let's take a look at our

746
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:01,836
overall timeline.

747
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,296
So, here's our whole flow, and

748
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,046
it all looks great, but let's

749
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,646
try to challenge our assumptions

750
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:10,626
as much as possible.

751
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:12,726
Now, what happens if the user

752
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,216
decides to go back to the watch

753
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:14,566
face?

754
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,546
So, we're no longer frontmost in

755
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,936
that case, but does that really

756
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:20,826
change anything?

757
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,446
Not really, right?

758
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:24,066
Let's take it through our app

759
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:27,666
code again.

760
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:29,116
So, we use the background

761
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,796
NSURLSession to post the order

762
00:23:30,796 --> 00:23:32,266
to our server, so if, right

763
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:34,016
afterwards, the user decided to

764
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,466
go back to the watch face, we

765
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:36,786
know that that will continue,

766
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:38,826
and then properly post the order

767
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:39,456
to our server.

768
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:41,276
And then, we just send a push

769
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,576
notification for all the

770
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:43,416
different stages.

771
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,276
So, even if we're not frontmost,

772
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:46,636
the user just gets a regular

773
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:47,366
notification.

774
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,696
And so, here we are at our

775
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,616
overall timeline.

776
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:55,636
So, we've handled the cases when

777
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,276
our server wasn't working

778
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:58,456
properly with the local

779
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:00,376
notification, and we've worked

780
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:01,836
through how to use some of the

781
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:03,446
new Frontmost App State to

782
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:04,926
provide a great experience to

783
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:05,466
our user.

784
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,556
And, the best part about all of

785
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:09,586
this is that our app works great

786
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:10,916
with or without the Frontmost

787
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,426
App State.

788
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,966
And so, we've now gone through

789
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,586
the Frontmost App State, and our

790
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:20,456
Unified Process Runtime, and how

791
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:21,156
it affects our app.

792
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:23,226
So, let's just now take some

793
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:24,886
time to revisit Background App

794
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:26,596
Refresh, which was introduced

795
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:27,996
last year, and see what

796
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:29,556
improvements we've added, and

797
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:30,886
how we can apply it to Apple Pie

798
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,006
Me.

799
00:24:32,276 --> 00:24:33,106
So, let's just go through a

800
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:33,856
brief overview.

801
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:37,456
So, in watchOS, the system wakes

802
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,006
your application by handing it a

803
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:40,846
task, and the system has a

804
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,286
limited number of these to hand

805
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:44,576
out, so just make sure to make

806
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:45,646
the best use of each one you

807
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:45,936
get.

808
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:48,956
And, when the system wants to

809
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:51,206
wake your app, it gives you one

810
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,146
or more of these tasks, and then

811
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:54,546
you can do any work you'd like

812
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,886
in the background, and you just

813
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:57,146
make sure to hold this task for

814
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,196
as long as you're doing work.

815
00:24:58,636 --> 00:25:01,116
And, the way in which the system

816
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,516
will deliver these tasks to you

817
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:04,716
is when you implement your

818
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,996
handle background tasks callback

819
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,966
on your WKExtension delegate.

820
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:15,726
And so, when you finish your

821
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:17,926
background work, you just return

822
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:19,506
the task to the system by

823
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:20,946
calling setTaskCompleted.

824
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,916
So, we've changed a little bit

825
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:26,026
of the API, so let's walk

826
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,106
through that now, now that we

827
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:28,156
have a good, conceptual

828
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:28,536
overview.

829
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:33,296
So, before, we would implement

830
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,046
our handle background tasks, and

831
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:36,446
then we would switch case on all

832
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:37,356
of the different tasks.

833
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:39,786
So, in this example, we have a

834
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,246
WKApplicationRefresh

835
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:44,466
BackgroundTask, and then, let's

836
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:45,426
say we perform whatever

837
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:46,806
functions we need to, to get our

838
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,546
app up to date, and then we just

839
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,726
want to schedule a snapshot.

840
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:51,456
And so, we use the

841
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:54,036
scheduleSnapshotRefresh, and we

842
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,536
use a preferred date.

843
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:56,966
And then, we just call

844
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:58,036
setTaskCompleted.

845
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:00,316
And, the important thing here

846
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:02,226
that was a little tricky was, it

847
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:03,616
was really important to call

848
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,646
setTaskCompleted after you

849
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,936
actually scheduled a snapshot

850
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:08,876
refresh, because if you called

851
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:10,846
it before, then, like I

852
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:12,506
mentioned, you're actually, by

853
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:14,306
calling setTaskCompleted, you're

854
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,766
returning the task to the

855
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:17,736
system, and no snapshot would

856
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:18,576
then be scheduled.

857
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,826
So, this was a little bit

858
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,776
cumbersome, and not the best

859
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:23,436
experience.

860
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,756
So now, all you have to do is

861
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:27,886
just call a new function that

862
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:27,976
says

863
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,956
setTaskCompletedWithSnapshot,

864
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:31,746
and you set it to be true when

865
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,286
you want that snapshot, and set

866
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:34,446
it to be false when you don't.

867
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:37,486
And so, for all tasks, the

868
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:39,296
default is just to take a

869
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:40,506
snapshot immediately.

870
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:43,696
However, for snapshot, just make

871
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:45,246
sure to remember that there's a

872
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:47,326
special call to setTaskCompleted

873
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:48,446
with a snapshot.

874
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,906
So, let's take a look at that.

875
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:54,246
So, here it is, again, we're

876
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,196
implementing our handle

877
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,606
background task, and this time,

878
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:57,606
we just have a

879
00:26:57,606 --> 00:26:59,676
WKSnapshotRefreshBackgroundTask,

880
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:01,256
so we're just going to call

881
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:02,966
setTaskCompleted with a restored

882
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,456
default state, and then our

883
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,096
estimatedSnapshotExpiration.

884
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,316
So, this is really great, and

885
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:10,956
it's very simple to use, but I

886
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:12,316
actually want to point out one

887
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:14,246
cool trick.

888
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,046
So now, you can actually use

889
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,926
setTaskCompletedWithSnapshot on

890
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:19,086
your snapshotTask.

891
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:22,036
So, what that does is it will,

892
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:23,126
of course, take a snapshot

893
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:25,206
immediately, and then it'll

894
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:26,976
actually schedule a snapshot an

895
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:28,506
hour from now, if you set it to

896
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:29,006
be true.

897
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:31,556
So, essentially what this means,

898
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:33,246
if you just keep calling

899
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:35,146
setTaskCompletedWithSnapshot as

900
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:36,776
true, you're going to set up a

901
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,366
one-hour cadence, and it's

902
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,906
really easy to constantly make

903
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:41,806
sure that your app is up to date

904
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:42,536
every hour.

905
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,076
And, if you want more custom

906
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,346
data behavior, for example, then

907
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:49,486
just make sure to call

908
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:51,216
setTaskCompletedWithSnapshot

909
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:54,526
false after scheduling your

910
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:56,366
snapshot refresh, because if you

911
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,166
call it with true in this case,

912
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:58,956
then we're actually going to

913
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,746
replace your previously

914
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,176
scheduled snapshot, and just

915
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,546
replace it with one an hour from

916
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:03,776
now.

917
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:05,356
So, if you do want that custom

918
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:06,966
behavior, just make sure to set

919
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:07,596
it to be false.

920
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:12,766
So, another important thing for

921
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,286
our handle background tasks is

922
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,586
how we actually update our

923
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:17,476
complications.

924
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,996
So, in watchOS 3, we actually

925
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:21,526
soft deprecated on our

926
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:24,576
CLKComplicationDataSource, our

927
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:26,976
getNextRequestedUpdateDate, our

928
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,406
requestedUpdateDidBegin, and our

929
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,336
requestedUpdateBudgetExhausted.

930
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:34,706
So now, in watchOS 3, I should

931
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:37,086
say, if you implemented handle

932
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:38,516
background tasks, these just

933
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,116
wouldn't get called into, and

934
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,076
now they're just fully

935
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:42,236
deprecated, so they won't get

936
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:43,026
called into at all.

937
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,226
So, if you want to update your

938
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,236
complications, again, just make

939
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,736
sure to handle background tasks,

940
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:51,076
and then just call

941
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,636
scheduleBackgroundRefresh with

942
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:54,966
whatever date you want to update

943
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:55,856
your complication.

944
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,816
And so, last year, a lot of

945
00:28:58,816 --> 00:29:00,236
times complications can be tied

946
00:29:00,236 --> 00:29:01,676
to some sort of networking task,

947
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,106
and so last year, we guided you

948
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:09,416
all to essentially, basically

949
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,896
just schedule a background

950
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:13,586
refresh, and then that way you

951
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,046
would schedule it maybe for,

952
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:17,266
let's say, 15 minutes from now,

953
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,466
if you wanted a complication

954
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,826
update by 7:45.

955
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,146
So, essentially you would

956
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,086
schedule that background

957
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:24,046
refresh, and then you would get

958
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,756
woken up around 7:30 to get that

959
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:28,686
NSURLSession, and then you could

960
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:31,696
trigger that, and then by 7:45,

961
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:33,246
you would have enough time to

962
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,406
update your complication.

963
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,296
But now, with some new

964
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:42,036
NSURLSession APIs, we can

965
00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:43,296
actually just reduce a step

966
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,006
here, and the reason we had

967
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:46,246
these steps was really because

968
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:48,086
we wanted to ensure we gave

969
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,786
enough background running time

970
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:51,136
to our NSURLSession.

971
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,856
But now, with some new API in

972
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:55,876
URLSessionTask, we can actually

973
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:56,966
just set an earliest begin date.

974
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,456
So, when we actually call the

975
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:02,066
download task, we can actually

976
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,866
just set on that task our

977
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:06,146
variable, earliestBeginDate, so

978
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:07,166
that way, we're telling the

979
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,856
system, "Hey, we don't need this

980
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:10,346
right now, we just need this at

981
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,076
whenever date we've specified."

982
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:16,776
And so now, we can actually just

983
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:17,796
reduce that step.

984
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,556
So, here in our schedule

985
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:21,296
background refresh, we probably

986
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:23,236
also just want to kick off our

987
00:30:23,286 --> 00:30:25,096
URLSession task, and set it up

988
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:26,586
with the earliest begin date,

989
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,896
and so that way the system, on

990
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,286
our behalf, will actually just

991
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,786
trigger that NSURLSession around

992
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:35,036
7:30 p.m., and then when that

993
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:37,626
resume comes back, we can update

994
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,626
our complication at 7:45 p.m.

995
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:44,646
So now, let's talk about how we

996
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,186
can actually incorporate some of

997
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,496
the Background App Refresh

998
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,556
things we just talked about into

999
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:53,386
our app, Apple Pie Me.

1000
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,866
So, here's that timeline we

1001
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:56,586
looked at earlier.

1002
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,696
So now, let's just focus in on

1003
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:00,176
the Pie's Cooking notification.

1004
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,226
So, if you remember, the code,

1005
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,406
before, it looked a lot like

1006
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:04,796
this.

1007
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,526
We implemented

1008
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,116
userNotificationCenter,

1009
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,716
willPresent notification with

1010
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:12,026
CompletionHandler, and then we

1011
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:13,576
just cancelled those fallback

1012
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:14,776
local notifications.

1013
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,496
We updated our UI.

1014
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,376
We then played a haptic, and

1015
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,586
called our completionHandler.

1016
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,396
And now, the great thing is,

1017
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:22,186
once you call that

1018
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,846
completionHandler, your app will

1019
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:26,306
get suspended, and you will get

1020
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:28,056
called into via handle

1021
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,816
background tasks with a snapshot

1022
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:31,566
task, and then your reason for

1023
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,116
that snapshot would be app

1024
00:31:33,116 --> 00:31:33,756
backgrounded.

1025
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:37,416
So now, when you have an ETA you

1026
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:39,186
can share, you can just make

1027
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,146
sure your snapshot looks as up

1028
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,606
to date as possible in the doc.

1029
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:45,336
And then, another thing I wanted

1030
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,606
to point out from before was, if

1031
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,206
you remember, we actually used,

1032
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,316
when the user raised their

1033
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:52,086
wrist, we then kicked off an

1034
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:54,336
NSURLSession to then grab the

1035
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:55,746
most up-to-date ETA.

1036
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,616
And so now, with that new API we

1037
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:58,946
just talked about on our

1038
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:01,266
URLSessionTask, we can actually

1039
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:03,516
just even schedule an ETA for

1040
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:04,416
some time from now.

1041
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,316
So, let's say, for example,

1042
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,716
maybe our pie's coming in 12

1043
00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:09,916
minutes, and we just want to

1044
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,956
schedule an ETA, like a refresh,

1045
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,486
around, let's say, like, eight

1046
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:15,736
minutes from now, for example.

1047
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:20,296
So, let's think about our

1048
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:21,946
overall timeline once again.

1049
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:23,616
This was a really simple app,

1050
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:24,016
actually.

1051
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:26,176
It was just, we had an Order

1052
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,126
button, and then we were able to

1053
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:28,616
eat pie.

1054
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:30,906
And then, but, it was actually

1055
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:33,946
really powerful under the

1056
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:37,946
surface in our app code, and so

1057
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:40,106
we were able to take advantage

1058
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:43,226
of our NSURLSession resumes, our

1059
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:45,496
haptics in conjunction with our

1060
00:32:45,736 --> 00:32:47,206
frontmost notifications.

1061
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:49,966
We're also taking advantage of

1062
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,846
our Background App Refresh, as

1063
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,516
well as we were able to schedule

1064
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:55,866
NSURLSession ETA requests.

1065
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:58,546
So, creating a great watch app

1066
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,236
that delivered you apple pies

1067
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,276
was certainly possible before,

1068
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:05,376
but now with watchOS 4, you can

1069
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:07,776
take a huge leap forward and wow

1070
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:08,496
your users.

1071
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:12,236
So now, let's dive into some of

1072
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:13,326
our new background modes.

1073
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:17,086
So, in watchOS 3, we introduced

1074
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:19,096
our workout session as a

1075
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,246
background mode, and now we

1076
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,686
actually have audio recording

1077
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:24,966
sessions, and then we also have

1078
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,126
navigation sessions.

1079
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:28,036
So, let's dive right into our

1080
00:33:28,036 --> 00:33:29,626
audio recording session.

1081
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:32,476
So, in watchOS 3, you could

1082
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:34,516
record audio, but it would,

1083
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:35,816
essentially the API would

1084
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,576
present a modal presentation

1085
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:40,606
that would show our UI, and then

1086
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:42,586
the user could then stop the

1087
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,176
recording, and then that file

1088
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,496
would get delivered to you all,

1089
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:46,116
the developer.

1090
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:49,306
However, now you can actually

1091
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:51,406
just use your own UI, so you can

1092
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,766
build the exact recording

1093
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,876
experience you want in watchOS4.

1094
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,426
And, the important thing is, now

1095
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:58,756
it can be background running

1096
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,356
but, of course, it's foreground

1097
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:01,756
initiated and background

1098
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,166
running, just like our workouts.

1099
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:06,826
And then, your app will stay

1100
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:09,926
frontmost while it's recording,

1101
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:12,686
and what's great about that is,

1102
00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:13,786
you actually have the ability to

1103
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:14,676
play haptics.

1104
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,306
So, let's say, for example,

1105
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,025
you're an app that wants to

1106
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:19,266
detect what sort of song is

1107
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,266
playing around you.

1108
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,306
You could easily just press the

1109
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:23,146
Record button.

1110
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:24,656
The user would put their wrist

1111
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:25,126
down.

1112
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:26,426
You could detect what's playing,

1113
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:27,835
and then you could easily tap

1114
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,045
your user, so they know that,

1115
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:30,255
hey, you detected what song it

1116
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:32,246
was, and then you could show

1117
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:33,076
that to your user.

1118
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:36,676
And then, what's also great is

1119
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:38,386
that, just like workout

1120
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,565
sessions, it's a background

1121
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:42,246
running mode, but the heart rate

1122
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,406
sensor is not going to be on, so

1123
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:44,696
there's actually less battery

1124
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:47,646
life impact because of this.

1125
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,036
And, another thing I wanted to

1126
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:51,946
mention is, if for some reason

1127
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:53,516
the user decides to go back to

1128
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:54,696
the watch face, for instance,

1129
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:55,966
we're going to show that

1130
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:58,456
Microphone icon at the very top,

1131
00:34:58,456 --> 00:34:59,886
so that way the user knows that

1132
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:01,516
something's recording, and then

1133
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:03,326
they can also tap on that icon

1134
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:04,706
and get launched right back to

1135
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:04,976
the app.

1136
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:12,446
So, for playback, in watchOS3.1,

1137
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,726
we introduced AVAudioPlayer, and

1138
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,306
so now, for recording, all you

1139
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:19,236
need to use is AVAudioInputNode

1140
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:21,086
via AVAudioEngine, or

1141
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:23,796
AVAudioRecorder, and then our

1142
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:25,226
AVAudio recording for

1143
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:25,806
permissions.

1144
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:28,146
And, there's a whole bunch of

1145
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:29,566
formats that are now supported.

1146
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:33,076
And so, let's talk about some of

1147
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:36,516
our locations background mode.

1148
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,416
So, just like audio recording

1149
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,286
and our workout sessions, it's

1150
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:41,936
foreground initiated, and then

1151
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:42,816
just background running.

1152
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:45,346
And, of course, you're going to

1153
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:46,876
be frontmost while in session.

1154
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,776
So, one thing to note is, you

1155
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,366
must call startUpdatingLocation

1156
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,166
while your app is in the

1157
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,496
foreground, and you should also

1158
00:35:56,496 --> 00:35:57,606
just make sure to set

1159
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,796
allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates

1160
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:01,596
to true only when the navigation

1161
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,206
session has actually begun, and

1162
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,406
then set it to be false when

1163
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,876
it's not.

1164
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,126
So, if you recall, for Apple Pie

1165
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,076
Me app, we actually had two

1166
00:36:11,076 --> 00:36:11,756
users.

1167
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:13,586
We had myself, the person that

1168
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,246
was about to eat that awesome

1169
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:17,056
apple pie, and then we actually

1170
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:18,256
had a courier that was going to

1171
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:19,076
bring it to us.

1172
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:20,636
So, in this case, we might

1173
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,286
actually just want to build a

1174
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:24,036
companion driver app for that

1175
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,126
driver, so that way they can

1176
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:27,486
easily be navigated on their

1177
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,236
wrist to our destination.

1178
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,906
And, the great thing is, you can

1179
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,076
even play haptics while in

1180
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:36,496
session, so now if, for example,

1181
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:38,556
for a right turn or a left turn,

1182
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:39,316
you could play a different

1183
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:41,566
haptic, or maybe when a user has

1184
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:43,156
missed a turn, for example.

1185
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:44,836
And, I'm really excited about

1186
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,726
this one, because, like, for

1187
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,036
example, transit apps that, you

1188
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:51,246
could imagine, you want to, just

1189
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,126
right before the stop you're

1190
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,946
about to get off at, the user

1191
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:56,056
could be easily tapped, and then

1192
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,046
they could know, oh, I need to

1193
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,906
go to the doors, and so I can

1194
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:03,216
get off at the next stop.

1195
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:05,636
So, we're really excited about

1196
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:07,616
our new Unified Process Runtime,

1197
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:09,006
our new enhancements to

1198
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:10,936
Background App Refresh, and our

1199
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:12,606
new background modes, and I

1200
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,266
especially am really excited

1201
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,916
about the new Frontmost App

1202
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:16,276
State.

1203
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:18,276
And, we think the design

1204
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,556
landscape will change in a

1205
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:21,466
really unique way on watchOS.

1206
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:27,366
So, I challenge you all to

1207
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:28,756
design apps for the new

1208
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:29,776
Frontmost App State.

1209
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:31,996
Think through the enhanced

1210
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:33,496
capabilities, and design

1211
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:34,626
experiences where the

1212
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:36,396
interactions are just two

1213
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:37,036
seconds.

1214
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,486
And so, we went through how to

1215
00:37:39,486 --> 00:37:42,536
use NSURLSession, haptics, and

1216
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:44,666
frontmost notifications, but

1217
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:45,816
that only really scratches the

1218
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:46,386
surface.

1219
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:48,146
With the enhancements to watch

1220
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:49,606
connectivity and task

1221
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:51,286
completions, you could design

1222
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,196
even more powerful interactions

1223
00:37:53,496 --> 00:37:54,886
that are incredibly simple to

1224
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:55,326
use.

1225
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,206
And so, I'm really excited to

1226
00:37:57,206 --> 00:37:58,676
see how you all take advantage

1227
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,866
of these new capabilities.

1228
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:02,206
So, if you want more information

1229
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:03,406
about this session or any other

1230
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,066
session, feel free to go to

1231
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,996
developer.apple.com, and then we

1232
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:08,846
have some great related

1233
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:09,426
sessions.

1234
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:10,746
There's a great one tomorrow for

1235
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,076
planning a great Apple Watch

1236
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:12,786
experience.

1237
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:14,336
I highly recommend checking it

1238
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:14,586
out.

1239
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,036
I'm super excited for that one.

1240
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:18,336
And, I hope you all have a great

1241
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:18,976
WWDC.

1242
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:19,646
Thank you.

1243
