00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:24,986
[ Applause ]

2
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:27,956
>> Hello. Good evening,

3
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:28,506
everyone.

4
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,116
My name is Samantha Mravca.

5
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,716
And I am really excited to share

6
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:32,986
with all of you, today, what's

7
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:34,666
new in ResearchKit and CareKit.

8
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,546
So, to start, as many of you

9
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:39,836
know, ResearchKit is an

10
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,126
opensource framework that we

11
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:42,726
released in 2015.

12
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:44,286
And it was designed to tackle

13
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,846
common challenges in research,

14
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,806
such as limited participation

15
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,106
and infrequent data, by enabling

16
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:51,706
both developers and researchers

17
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:53,316
to create and execute large

18
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:55,266
scale studies, using our iOS

19
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:55,756
devices.

20
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,386
After the launch of ResearchKit,

21
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:00,186
our team focused their energy on

22
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,736
a more patient centric approach

23
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:02,226
to health.

24
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:03,366
Which eventually led to the

25
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,166
creation of ResearchKit's sister

26
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,026
framework, CareKit.

27
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:09,426
CareKit was released in 2016 and

28
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:10,916
it was designed to empower

29
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,316
patients by enabling them to

30
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:13,636
take a more active role in their

31
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:14,046
own care.

32
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:15,826
And so, although these

33
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,746
frameworks were built with

34
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,056
different audiences in mind,

35
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:19,766
they truly work together.

36
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,306
Not only as sister frameworks,

37
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,846
but they were built to sit

38
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:24,076
beautifully on top of Apple's

39
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:24,936
HealthKit framework.

40
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:26,426
That way, they can leverage and

41
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:27,746
share the rich health data from

42
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:28,816
other third-party apps and

43
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:29,366
devices.

44
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,856
And so, by combining the power

45
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:33,746
of all three, you can create a

46
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:35,216
truly elevated experience for

47
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:35,956
your end user.

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,946
So, even just since last WWDC,

49
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:41,226
we've seen lots more ResearchKit

50
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,816
and CareKit apps pop up all over

51
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:43,286
the globe.

52
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,266
And so, quickly, before we jump

53
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,326
into the rest of the talk, let's

54
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:47,316
just take a look at some of

55
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:47,996
these examples.

56
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:51,386
So, to start, in the U.K.

57
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:53,586
MyAsthma is a ResearchKit app

58
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,796
that helps patients better

59
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:55,786
understand their asthma

60
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:57,666
triggers, as well as important

61
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,516
information about their

62
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,126
surrounding environment.

63
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,096
Over in Japan, Nestle Skin

64
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:04,596
Health recently released their

65
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:06,506
ResearchKit app to study common

66
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,006
skin conditions by using

67
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:09,205
accelerometer data from the

68
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,826
watch to detect scratching

69
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:11,416
during sleep.

70
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:15,946
And down in Australia, Professor

71
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:17,296
Timothy Skinner and his team

72
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,896
have developed a CareKit app

73
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,376
emojifit Diabetes, which makes

74
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,456
great use of emojis to convey

75
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:25,016
often overwhelming and confusing

76
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:26,466
medical information to patients

77
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:27,186
trying to manage their

78
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:27,756
condition.

79
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,866
And lastly, back in the U.S.,

80
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:33,306
PPD Act is a ResearchKit app

81
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,186
from the researchers at UNC

82
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,266
Chapel Hill that is aimed to

83
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,576
better understand the genetic

84
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,286
basis of postpartum depression.

85
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,206
And Sharp Healthcare is working

86
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,016
on their CareKit app to help

87
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,556
their patients post eye surgery.

88
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,236
That way they can stick to their

89
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,826
recovery plans in those crucial

90
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,036
weeks immediately following

91
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:52,616
their surgery.

92
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,316
And so, these are just some of

93
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,656
the examples of the amazing

94
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:57,946
ResearchKit and CareKit apps

95
00:02:58,016 --> 00:02:59,496
that we have seen launched over

96
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:00,496
the last few years.

97
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,996
And we are so excited to keep

98
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:03,656
seeing more.

99
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:05,086
But with that, let's go ahead

100
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,016
and jump into the rest of our

101
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:06,356
talk.

102
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,596
And we can start off by going

103
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:10,366
over the new features in both of

104
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,536
the CareKit and ResearchKit

105
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:11,996
frameworks.

106
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,046
After that, I'll invite up my

107
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,356
coworker, Srinath, who will

108
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:17,376
share a new CareKit prototyping

109
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,386
tool with all of you.

110
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:20,186
And then, once he's done, I'll

111
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,536
jump back up onstage and we can

112
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,956
talk about the community and our

113
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,036
collaboration together.

114
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,326
So, let's start with

115
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:27,846
ResearchKit, our new updates and

116
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:28,256
features.

117
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,576
And the first update we have for

118
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:32,336
you is a small but powerful

119
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,576
change, that we made to the Tone

120
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:34,566
Audiometry task.

121
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,786
As many of you know, this Tone

122
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,776
Audiometry active test is a

123
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:39,426
hearing test.

124
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,566
During which users are asked to

125
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,986
wear headphones and listen to a

126
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:44,176
series of different audio

127
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:45,516
frequencies, that can be

128
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,686
delivered to either the left or

129
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:47,166
right ear.

130
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,416
As users hear these frequencies,

131
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,836
they will progressively increase

132
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:52,766
in volume until the user taps a

133
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,926
button to indicate that they've

134
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:54,746
heard the sound.

135
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:57,236
And in the old version, we just

136
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,656
had one button for them to tap.

137
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,746
But now, we are including both a

138
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:01,876
left and right button.

139
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,226
That way, not only can you

140
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:04,286
indicate when you've heard the

141
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,846
tone, but you can also specify

142
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,776
which ear you've heard it in.

143
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,026
So, next we have a brand new

144
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:12,496
active test developed by one of

145
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,146
our own Apple engineers, the

146
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:14,786
Stroop Test.

147
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:16,625
This test helps measure

148
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,625
selective attention by asking

149
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,065
participants to focus their

150
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,526
attention on one stimulus, while

151
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,416
ignoring another.

152
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:24,786
So, during this test, users will

153
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,566
see two possible combinations of

154
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,936
text and tint appear on the

155
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:28,996
screen in front of them.

156
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,206
And these can be either

157
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,356
concordant or discordant.

158
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,176
And you can see on the screen

159
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,096
here, that we must ignore the

160
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,646
text and instead, select the

161
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:38,996
button that reflects the tint

162
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,216
color that we see displayed.

163
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:43,296
As users continue to complete

164
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:44,766
these attempts, a pass or fail

165
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,576
will be recorded for each

166
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,306
attempt, as well as the time to

167
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:51,916
complete the test.

168
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,066
So, next we have a contribution

169
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:54,856
from the community.

170
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,206
And I'd like to thank Faraz

171
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,546
Hussain, who is one of the By

172
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,236
Effect app developers from the

173
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:00,876
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

174
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,216
ResearchKit Mood Challenge.

175
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:04,266
He has contributed the Trail

176
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,546
Making Test, which is a

177
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,206
neuropsychological test of

178
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,666
visual attention and task

179
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,246
switching.

180
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,336
And during this test, users must

181
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,456
connect a series of labeled

182
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:14,726
circles, as you see here, on the

183
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:17,996
screen, from one A, two B, three

184
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:18,816
C, and so on.

185
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:19,896
And then, the time to complete

186
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,176
this test will be recorded.

187
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:25,856
And the last active task we have

188
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:27,426
is the new Range of Motion

189
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:28,166
Active Task.

190
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,236
And a big thanks goes to Doctor

191
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,106
Raj Karia, John Guydo, and

192
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,076
Darren Levy for contributing the

193
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:36,176
Range of Motion Active Task.

194
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:37,396
This lets you measure both

195
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,536
flexed and extended positions.

196
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,946
And from the beginning, users

197
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,156
will be asked to place their

198
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,576
device in the proper location.

199
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,296
And then, using a touch anywhere

200
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,306
active task, they can simply tap

201
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,376
the screen to indicate that

202
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:50,526
they're ready to proceed with

203
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,136
the rest of the steps.

204
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:53,776
And so, as they continue to

205
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,106
follow the steps in this test,

206
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,206
recordings from both the

207
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,966
accelerometer and the gyroscope

208
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:58,776
will be recorded.

209
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,656
And what's even more, is not

210
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:01,916
only did they contribute this

211
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,876
for the shoulder.

212
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,096
But they contributed another

213
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,476
version with the company assets

214
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:06,736
for the knee, as well.

215
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:10,576
And so, lastly, I'd like to

216
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,836
highlight a new video

217
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,036
instruction step for

218
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:13,596
ResearchKit.

219
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,646
This was contributed by Oliver

220
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:16,096
Shcaefer.

221
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,016
So, thank you, Oliver.

222
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,116
And this step makes it really

223
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:20,456
easy, now, for you to display

224
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:22,056
video content within your apps,

225
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,416
from either a remote or local

226
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:23,756
source.

227
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:27,306
And so, with that, you have the

228
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,536
latest updates and features to

229
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,766
ResearchKit, including several

230
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:30,616
contributions from the

231
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:31,146
community.

232
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,656
And additionally, we will also,

233
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,406
now be assigning a visual object

234
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,886
identifier to the ResearchKit

235
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:36,656
repository.

236
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,186
That way, as you all bring the

237
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,746
results of these studies to the

238
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,376
academic community, you can now

239
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,696
reference the framework using

240
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,496
this unique string.

241
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:48,046
So, with that, I would like to

242
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:50,196
go ahead and jump into CareKit.

243
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:51,696
So, as you know it today,

244
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,586
CareKit consists of four core

245
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:54,086
modules.

246
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:57,526
A Care Card, a Symptom Tracker,

247
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,316
an Insights module, as well as a

248
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,206
Connect module.

249
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,256
And so, today, the Care Card

250
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,656
lets patients view all of their

251
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,936
daily interventions.

252
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:07,716
These are things like completing

253
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,136
medication or stretches.

254
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,396
And the Symptom Tracker lets

255
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,926
patients view all of their

256
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,516
subjective or objective

257
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,056
measurements that they track.

258
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,026
And these could be things like

259
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:17,926
tracking weight and blood

260
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:19,346
pressure, or mood and pain

261
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:19,726
scores.

262
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:21,796
And so, over the last year we

263
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,496
have heard feedback that many

264
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,746
patients would like to see all

265
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,956
of their activities, both

266
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:27,196
interventions and assessments,

267
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,156
in one view.

268
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:30,136
And so, to support that feedback

269
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,776
our team has created what we are

270
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:33,586
calling our Care Contents view.

271
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,276
Which lets you combine all of

272
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:36,566
those activities and see them in

273
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:37,276
one tab.

274
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,446
So, let's go ahead and take a

275
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,716
look at this new Care Contents

276
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:41,016
view.

277
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,646
And you'll see in my example

278
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,376
CareKit app that I've set up to

279
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,166
help manage my migraines, we can

280
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,466
see all of my activities, here.

281
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,436
And they all contribute to the

282
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:49,616
same completion score at the

283
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:49,916
top.

284
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,936
But let's go ahead and jump into

285
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:53,556
this and dig in, piece by piece.

286
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,476
Because we have lots of other

287
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:55,486
updates to share, as well.

288
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:58,186
And you'll see here, at the top,

289
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,856
we have a new header view with

290
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,496
lots of UI updates, including

291
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:02,726
this new ring view, to show

292
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:03,376
completion.

293
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,046
As well as the new heart icon in

294
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:05,666
the center.

295
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,826
As users complete their

296
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,276
activities for the day, this

297
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,306
ring will fill up.

298
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:11,806
And once they reach 100%

299
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,476
completion, the circle will fill

300
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,076
in and a star badge will appear

301
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,576
in its place, which you can see

302
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,576
in the week view at the top.

303
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,316
And this lets user quickly

304
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,376
glance and have an idea for 100%

305
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,346
compliance days.

306
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:24,566
And what's even more exciting,

307
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,866
is that this new heart icon you

308
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:27,896
see in the center is just one of

309
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,566
28 icons designed by Apple's own

310
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,206
HI team.

311
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:32,996
And you can now, leverage these

312
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,405
glyphs and icons within your own

313
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,126
CareKit apps.

314
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:36,885
And not only will they display

315
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,025
beautifully on the patient app

316
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,436
that you just saw, but they'll

317
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,796
also appear beautifully as a

318
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:41,986
complication on the watch.

319
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,515
That way patients can quickly

320
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:44,986
glance at their daily progress

321
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:46,936
for the day.

322
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,716
And so, using these new glyphs

323
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,926
is really straightforward.

324
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,486
All you need to do is just set

325
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:52,696
the glyph properties within the

326
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,166
view controller, and then your

327
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,866
desired icon will display upon

328
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,196
navigating back to your Care

329
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:57,966
Contents view.

330
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:01,006
If we zoom out and we look at

331
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,426
the rest of my Care Contents

332
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,696
tab, you'll see at the top,

333
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:05,346
here, my three intervention

334
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,466
activities for the day.

335
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,976
Of which I've already completed

336
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,196
several, including two of my

337
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:10,396
breathing exercises from my

338
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:10,706
watch.

339
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,356
I probably should have done

340
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,306
another one.

341
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,486
But we'll go ahead and scroll

342
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,156
down, and we'll see that we also

343
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,466
have my two assessments.

344
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,016
My two assessments for sleep and

345
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:21,236
stress.

346
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,896
My sleep data is coming directly

347
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,386
from HealthKit, that way I don't

348
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,366
need to do any additional entry

349
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,096
on my part.

350
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,796
And then, my stress survey, I

351
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:31,096
can quickly fill out using a

352
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:31,856
ResearchKit survey.

353
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,556
And unfortunately, you notice

354
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:34,506
that I did not get much sleep

355
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,626
last night, and I was a bit

356
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:36,936
stressed when I took my survey.

357
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,526
I think if I took that survey an

358
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:39,746
hour ago, it probably would have

359
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,226
been ten.

360
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:41,856
But let's go ahead and scroll

361
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,056
down, and look at the rest of my

362
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:43,996
Care Contents view.

363
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,596
And you'll notice that we've

364
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:47,076
made a few other updates, here.

365
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:49,906
The first one lets you now tag

366
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:51,336
activities as optional.

367
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:52,856
And so, this means that these

368
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,256
activities will not contribute

369
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:55,366
to your daily completion score,

370
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:55,896
at the top.

371
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,206
So, as you can see here, it's

372
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,436
great for take-as-needed

373
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:01,226
medications, like my ibuprofen,

374
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:02,906
that we don't actually require

375
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,406
for the patient to take as part

376
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:04,926
of their care plan.

377
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:08,436
Right below that, you'll see

378
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:09,816
another new activity that we

379
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,336
have, which is a new Read Only

380
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:11,986
activity.

381
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:13,756
And this lets you now, just

382
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,466
display informational text to

383
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,986
the user, that actually doesn't

384
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,386
require any action on their

385
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:18,686
part.

386
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:21,656
So, let's go ahead and take a

387
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:22,796
look at how we can create these

388
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:23,976
new optional and Read Only

389
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:24,566
activities.

390
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,796
As you can see, here, our team

391
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:29,526
has created a brand new Boolean

392
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,176
parameter, specifically for

393
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:31,936
optionality.

394
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,236
And as you saw on the Care

395
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:34,456
Contents view, by setting that

396
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,786
to true, it will prevent my

397
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,186
ibuprofen from actually

398
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:38,336
contributing to my daily

399
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,226
completion score.

400
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,726
We also, took a look at the new

401
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,456
Read Only activities to display

402
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:45,636
information to the user.

403
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:47,486
And you'll also notice that we

404
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:48,766
created a new Read Only

405
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,606
initializer.

406
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,176
Which this will allow you to

407
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,426
now, create these activities the

408
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:53,546
same as you would any other

409
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:54,316
activity type.

410
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,996
And so, there you have our new

411
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,656
combined view, that we're

412
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,006
calling Care Contents, with all

413
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,006
of your activities,

414
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,306
interventions, and assessments

415
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:03,896
on the same tab.

416
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,316
As well as some new other

417
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,486
activities that we just saw.

418
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:08,926
And so, with that, I'd like to

419
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,786
now jump into a new topic and

420
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,336
introduce you to a brand new API

421
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:14,476
that we have built this year, to

422
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:15,336
support thresholds.

423
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,126
So, this new API will let

424
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:20,046
developers set and track two

425
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,206
different threshold types,

426
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,586
adherence or numeric, which you

427
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:24,936
can link to specific Care Plan

428
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:25,546
activities.

429
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,636
And so, let's look at how we can

430
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:28,466
create these thresholds in the

431
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:28,796
code.

432
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,286
And you'll see it's pretty

433
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,186
straightforward, again.

434
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,036
Just depending on which type of

435
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:34,146
threshold you want to use.

436
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:35,146
You just need to make sure that

437
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,296
you're using the corresponding

438
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,246
initializer type.

439
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:39,796
So, while numeric thresholds can

440
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:41,356
only be applied to assessments,

441
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,236
adherence thresholds can be

442
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,956
applied to both assessments and

443
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:45,676
interventions.

444
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:47,866
And once you've gone ahead and

445
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,196
created those thresholds, you

446
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,556
can then use them to perform any

447
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:51,726
custom logic you want.

448
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,626
The Care Plan store is going to

449
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,256
automatically notify you any

450
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,596
time one of these new thresholds

451
00:11:56,596 --> 00:11:57,446
has been invoked.

452
00:11:57,786 --> 00:11:59,046
And so, to support this new

453
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,836
capability, our team has gone

454
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,626
ahead and made a few updates to

455
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:03,656
the Insights tab.

456
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,906
That way we could leverage these

457
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:05,996
thresholds and display them in a

458
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:06,456
nice way.

459
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:09,616
So, here at the top, you'll see

460
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,386
a brand new widgets view.

461
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,466
And this lets you display up to

462
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,826
three widgets for you to now,

463
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,296
highlight key values to your

464
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:16,836
patients.

465
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:19,126
What's even more, is you can

466
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,586
link these widgets to a Care

467
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:21,566
Plan activity.

468
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:22,466
And then, you don't need to do

469
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,366
any additional work.

470
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,156
And all of the values and widget

471
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:26,916
colors can update automatically,

472
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,676
based on the most recent data

473
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:29,686
inputs, as well as the

474
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:30,686
thresholds that you've already

475
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:30,896
set.

476
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:33,266
So, let's take a look at how we

477
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,186
can create these widgets.

478
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:35,686
And we'll start by checking out

479
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,336
my Stress Assessment that we saw

480
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:38,646
from my Care Contents view.

481
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:40,306
So, here we have my Stress

482
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:40,776
Assessment.

483
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,186
And we'll see that the first

484
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:43,496
method for creating widgets

485
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,256
actually handles all of the data

486
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,636
fetching and updating for me.

487
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,626
All we need to do is just link

488
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,206
it to the Activity identifier

489
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:51,756
that we want to display, and the

490
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:52,726
rest will happen behind the

491
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:53,076
scenes.

492
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:56,956
The second method for creating

493
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,356
widgets allows for a little bit

494
00:12:58,356 --> 00:12:59,656
more customization.

495
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:02,366
You can specify exactly what you

496
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,306
want to display, by just using

497
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:05,796
the title and text parameters,

498
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:06,506
as you see, here.

499
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,106
And so then, once you've gone

500
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:10,556
ahead and created these widgets,

501
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,266
it's then, really easy to pass

502
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,296
them into the view controller

503
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:14,606
you saw, by using our new

504
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:15,706
patientWidgets parameter.

505
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,636
And this will help ensure that

506
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:19,196
your desired widgets will appear

507
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,386
when you navigate back to your

508
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:21,686
Insights tab.

509
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:24,416
So additionally, some thresholds

510
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,276
might require additional text or

511
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,326
information that you want to

512
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,096
give the user.

513
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,526
And so, we've created this

514
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,836
separate section, below, for

515
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:31,676
threshold alerts.

516
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:32,976
That way, you can create

517
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:34,126
messages for specific

518
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:34,756
activities.

519
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,646
And this will be evaluated the

520
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,176
same as the widgets above, and

521
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,066
automatically display if one of

522
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,026
those thresholds has been

523
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:41,406
invoked.

524
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:44,436
And so, there you have our

525
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,876
Insights tab, which we've

526
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,366
updated to really leverage these

527
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:48,886
new threshold APIs that we've

528
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:49,096
built.

529
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:50,766
And let's go ahead and jump into

530
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,696
our last tab for CareKit, which

531
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:53,066
is Connect.

532
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:55,316
You'll notice a lot of the same

533
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,816
features, here, including our

534
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,566
Profile header view, as well as

535
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,556
your care team members and

536
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:00,356
contact cards.

537
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,116
But you'll also notice this new

538
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:02,996
inbox feature.

539
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:05,046
And if we tap into that, it will

540
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:06,676
take me to my messaging screen

541
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:07,766
with my care team member.

542
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,886
So, our team has gone ahead and

543
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:11,566
built the UI that will allow

544
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:12,906
developers who want to take

545
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,556
Connect one step further, by

546
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:15,876
connecting their patients to

547
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,046
their care teams directly

548
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:17,826
through messaging.

549
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:22,146
So, there you have CareKit.

550
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,136
And we've made lots of update,

551
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:26,536
including our brand new combined

552
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:29,236
view, as well as UI and features

553
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,446
across all of our tabs.

554
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,816
And additionally, we are also

555
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,346
announcing a new bridge API for

556
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:36,576
CareKit, that will allow you to

557
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,876
now synch this data with

558
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,126
compatible HIPAA compliant

559
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:39,706
backends.

560
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,296
And to learn more about that, I

561
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:42,406
highly recommend going to

562
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,596
tomorrow's talk, hosted by

563
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,456
Kelsey Dedoshka, on Connecting

564
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:46,266
CareKit to the Cloud.

565
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:50,126
So, up until this point, we have

566
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:51,356
focused a lot of our attention

567
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,676
on the developer community.

568
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,636
But we understand that CareKit

569
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:56,656
has a much wider audience that's

570
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:57,796
interested in this framework.

571
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,646
And that is namely those of you

572
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,186
in the medical profession, as

573
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:02,166
well as those of you in

574
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:02,706
academia.

575
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,226
So, I'm really excited to say

576
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,806
that this year, we are releasing

577
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,406
a new tool for nontechnical

578
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:08,836
audience.

579
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,556
And to talk more about that, I

580
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,566
will invite my coworker,

581
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:12,676
Srinath, up to the stage.

582
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:15,676
>> Thank you, Sam.

583
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,186
Hello, everybody.

584
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,736
My name is Srinath.

585
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,166
I'm a software engineer at

586
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:20,536
Apple.

587
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,496
And today, I'm here to talk to

588
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:23,826
you about the CareKit

589
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:24,656
Prototyping Tool.

590
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,086
Developing Healthcare centric

591
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,846
apps comes with its own set of

592
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:30,666
challenges, as many of you might

593
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,576
have experienced.

594
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,876
But the most interesting one is

595
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:35,456
that it requires a lot of

596
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,126
collaboration between the deeply

597
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,016
knowledgeable healthcare

598
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:41,326
community and the amazing app

599
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:41,956
developers.

600
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:45,756
Now let's say, for example, that

601
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:48,146
I am a physician and I'm really

602
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,966
interested in exploring the

603
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,656
possibility of taking a post

604
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:54,786
discharge treatment plan, which

605
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,696
I conventionally hand out to my

606
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,596
patients as a piece of paper.

607
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,346
And somewhat digitizing it, by

608
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,436
converting it into an app that

609
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,386
is easy to use and which would

610
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:07,836
also allow my patients to track

611
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,916
their medications and adherence

612
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,536
on a day to day basis.

613
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,226
Which is crucial for their

614
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:15,306
successful recovery.

615
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:18,336
Now, this sounds like an amazing

616
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,626
idea and I'd love to pitch this

617
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:21,466
to my department.

618
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,796
But before I can do that, there

619
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,496
are a few things which I need to

620
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:26,526
do on my own.

621
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:30,076
First, I try to explore what

622
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,186
technology is already available,

623
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:33,656
out there, that can help me

624
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,736
achieve this goal.

625
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:37,746
Then, I move on to creating some

626
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,156
sort of rough sketches in order

627
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:41,836
to visually represent to other

628
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,496
people what exactly I have in my

629
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:44,896
mind.

630
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:48,676
And then, finally, I feel that

631
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,626
I'm well prepared to take this

632
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,026
idea to my department.

633
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:54,276
And if, and only if, they

634
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:56,566
approve it do I get to hire the

635
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,716
necessary resources to get

636
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,726
started on developing the actual

637
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:02,186
app.

638
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,346
Now, switching back to my

639
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:05,806
developer mode, it's interesting

640
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:07,506
to note that the initial few

641
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,396
steps of this process is

642
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,205
typically handled by someone who

643
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,026
has little or no experience with

644
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,205
iOS app development.

645
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,546
Ever since we announced the

646
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,636
CareKit framework, in 2016,

647
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,156
we've received a ton of requests

648
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:22,705
from healthcare professionals

649
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:24,675
and people in academia.

650
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:27,376
Inquiring about nontechnical

651
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,206
resources that can help them

652
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:30,786
better understand the

653
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,506
capabilities of the CareKit

654
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:33,046
framework.

655
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,366
This is when we realized that

656
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,526
there seems to be a barrier for

657
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,086
entry for our nontechnical

658
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:40,596
audience.

659
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:43,106
Which is why we've come up with

660
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,346
a tool that can help simplify

661
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:47,896
this process, by allowing anyone

662
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,666
to create a custom prototype

663
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:53,106
CareKit app, without having to

664
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,566
write any code, at all.

665
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,786
Now, by the end of this talk

666
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:58,436
you'll be able to take a

667
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:00,426
treatment plan that looks like

668
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,816
this, and convert it into a

669
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,736
prototype CareKit app that looks

670
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:08,536
like this, just by modifying the

671
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:10,396
contents of a human readable

672
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:10,736
file.

673
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:14,966
Now, before I show you guys how

674
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,416
this can be done with a demo,

675
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,996
let's take a step back in order

676
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,976
to see how this thing is wired

677
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,406
up, under the hood.

678
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:27,656
So, what we have here, is a page

679
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,446
which we call the Care Contents

680
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:29,676
view.

681
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:32,236
You will be able to add all the

682
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,546
medications and assessments

683
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,046
which you want your patients to

684
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,146
adhere to on a day to day basis.

685
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,306
What we have done is we have

686
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,536
created a mapping between the

687
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,556
underlying code that generates

688
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,916
this page, and the parameters

689
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,986
which define the characteristics

690
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,986
of every single element.

691
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:56,306
But let's take a closer look at

692
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:57,316
what I'm talking about.

693
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:00,846
So, what we have here, is called

694
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,906
an assessment.

695
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:03,936
Now, your patients will be able

696
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:04,876
to tap on this.

697
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,276
And in this example, they'll be

698
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,636
able to enter a value in a scale

699
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:11,386
of one to ten, in order to

700
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:13,056
denote how much pain they are

701
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,806
experiencing at that given point

702
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:15,226
in time.

703
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,776
Now, this element can be

704
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:19,986
represented in a simple tabular

705
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:22,326
format that looks something like

706
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:22,756
this.

707
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:27,156
Now, the values which you type

708
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:29,826
into this table will help

709
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,096
characterize the element that

710
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:33,476
you're seeing on that page.

711
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,336
Now, let's try modifying some of

712
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:37,426
these values and see what

713
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:37,896
happens.

714
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:41,996
So, now I'm trying to create an

715
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:44,176
activity which is of type

716
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:44,856
intervention.

717
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,716
And more specifically, I want to

718
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,756
create an intervention for the

719
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,066
acetaminophen drug.

720
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:56,736
Now, this new table will map to

721
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,066
a totally different element on

722
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,976
my UI, as you can see here.

723
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,836
I believe that now is a good

724
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,686
time for me to introduce to you,

725
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,846
as to how we have implemented

726
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:10,786
this mapping.

727
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:13,566
We are using something known as

728
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,676
a PLIST file.

729
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:16,836
Now, for all the developers in

730
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,976
the audience, you guys know that

731
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:21,266
a PLIST file is basically an xml

732
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,636
file, in which you can have key

733
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:23,466
value pairings.

734
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:25,836
But for our nontechnical

735
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,896
audience, you can think of it as

736
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,966
a form which has different

737
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,686
fields that you can fill out.

738
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:36,066
We have gone ahead and applied

739
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,966
this mapping throughout the

740
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:38,766
CareKit framework.

741
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:42,366
So, for example, here you see

742
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:43,646
the Insights tab.

743
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:46,536
This is a great place for you to

744
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,096
display critical information to

745
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,606
your patients in the form of

746
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,876
widgets, threshold parameters,

747
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:55,766
adherence messages, and charts.

748
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:57,956
All these elements are

749
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:58,756
configurable.

750
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:01,296
For example, the widgets that

751
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,266
you are seeing on top of your

752
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,506
screen here, can be easily

753
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:06,356
mapped, once again, to a tabular

754
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:08,296
format that looks something like

755
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:08,656
this.

756
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,876
And similarly, for the Contacts

757
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:15,086
tab, depending on what values

758
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:17,016
you provide as part of the PLIST

759
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,736
file, you'll be able to

760
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,526
characterize the contact which

761
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:25,986
you want to add.

762
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,166
So, now that we have seen how

763
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,356
this mapping methodology works,

764
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:32,736
in order for us to get started

765
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:34,926
on using this tool there are two

766
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,206
important components that are

767
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:36,806
necessary.

768
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:42,356
The first one is called XCode.

769
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:45,996
And to all the developers, here,

770
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:48,236
I hope you guys know what XCode

771
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:49,016
already is.

772
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,646
And for our nontechnical

773
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:52,686
audience, please bear with me

774
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,656
for a second, while I try to

775
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,246
explain to them, what XCode is

776
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,096
in a succinct manner.

777
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,396
You can think of XCode as the

778
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:01,816
one stop shop for creating apps

779
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,686
that can run on any Apple

780
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:04,196
device.

781
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:07,676
And let's leave it at that.

782
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,206
So, XCode is an application

783
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,806
which is provided by Apple.

784
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:12,916
And you can download it for free

785
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:14,266
from the Mac App Store.

786
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,676
You can just tap on install and

787
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:19,386
it'll automatically show up in

788
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:20,556
your Applications folder.

789
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,586
Now, the second part to this

790
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:26,716
puzzle is called CareKit

791
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:27,336
Repository.

792
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:29,706
This is nothing else but a bunch

793
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,056
of files that you need to

794
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:33,226
download in order to start using

795
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:34,696
the CareKit Prototyping Tool.

796
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:36,786
And this is available from our

797
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,726
website, CareKit.org.

798
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:42,156
You can scroll down and tap on

799
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:44,446
the menu that says get it on

800
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:44,786
GitHub.

801
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:47,586
That'll take you to a new page.

802
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,826
And from there, you can click on

803
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:52,146
the Download button in order to

804
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:53,886
download a zip of the file.

805
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:59,006
Now that we are all set up to

806
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:00,656
start using this tool, let's

807
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,396
jump right into a demo where

808
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:04,086
I'll show you how you can build

809
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:07,206
a custom prototype CareKit app.

810
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:12,500
[ Applause ]

811
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:17,576
So, this machine already has

812
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:18,546
XCode installed.

813
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:19,626
So, right now, what I'm going to

814
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:21,086
do, is I'm going to go ahead and

815
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,136
fetch the files from the CareKit

816
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,736
repository.

817
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,366
So, I'm going to type in here

818
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:26,506
CareKit.org.

819
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:29,256
I'm going to scroll down, get it

820
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:31,306
on GitHub, and when I tap on the

821
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,346
Download button, here, I have an

822
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:33,646
option that says Download Zip.

823
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:35,676
And you'll notice that the files

824
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:36,976
have downloaded, already.

825
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:38,896
So, let me open that up.

826
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:40,856
And now, I'm going to just close

827
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:43,186
out Safari, because I don't need

828
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:43,706
it anymore.

829
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:45,886
So, this is a bunch of files

830
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:46,936
which we will be able to see,

831
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:47,786
immediately.

832
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,746
And you don't have to bother

833
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:50,456
about all of them.

834
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:51,946
The files which you are

835
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,636
interested in is located in this

836
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:54,956
folder called the CareKit

837
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:55,826
Prototyping Tool.

838
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:58,206
And inside this, you can double

839
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:00,286
tap on OCKPrototyper.

840
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,206
And the particular file which

841
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:03,576
you need to open is called

842
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:06,266
OCKPrototyper dot xcodeproject.

843
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,446
So, now when I click on this and

844
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,426
tap Open, it'll automatically

845
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:12,116
launch using the XCode app,

846
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,276
which I just downloaded from the

847
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,166
App Store.

848
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:18,236
So, this is your first look at

849
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:18,676
XCode.

850
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,636
And before we get started with

851
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:23,116
modifying anything, let's try to

852
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:25,226
run this Prototype app and see

853
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,106
what is looks like.

854
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,376
Now, in order to do that, you

855
00:24:28,376 --> 00:24:30,566
have to focus on the top left

856
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,256
corner, only.

857
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,156
Make sure that you have selected

858
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:34,096
CareKit Patient.

859
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:35,466
These individual elements are

860
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:36,176
called schemes.

861
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:37,736
And we are interested in the

862
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:38,746
CareKit Patient scheme.

863
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:40,706
And then, you need to decide

864
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:42,266
which device do you want to run

865
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,476
your prototype app on.

866
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:45,826
And here, I'm going to select

867
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:46,826
iPhone 7 Plus.

868
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:49,076
And in order to start running

869
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,366
this, all you have to do is

870
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,126
press the Play button, right

871
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:52,396
here.

872
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:54,216
So, there we go.

873
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:57,406
So, here you'll notice that we

874
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,186
have launched a new window, and

875
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:00,316
this is called the iPhone

876
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:00,906
Simulator.

877
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:02,376
This is an application which

878
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,286
tries to mimic an iOS device,

879
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,616
very accurately.

880
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,446
So, here you'll notice that the

881
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:09,276
app has launched.

882
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:11,326
It already has the three

883
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:12,196
important tabs.

884
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:13,306
The first one is called Care

885
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:13,876
Contents.

886
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:16,036
Now, as I start interacting with

887
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:17,846
every single element to indicate

888
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:18,976
that I've completed this

889
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,726
medication, you'll notice that

890
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,326
it is contributing towards my

891
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:23,536
daily completion goal.

892
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,436
Which is my adherence, as well.

893
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:27,976
The next one is called Insights.

894
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,266
Here, you'll notice that I

895
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,776
already have a couple of widget

896
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:31,206
items.

897
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,166
And I have a prepopulated chart,

898
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:34,586
as well.

899
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,066
The final tab is called Connect.

900
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:38,676
Here, you have the different

901
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:39,946
contact, along with some

902
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:40,556
information.

903
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,356
And you also, have the brand new

904
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:44,156
Inbox UI, which Sam spoke about.

905
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,546
So, you can tap in here, type

906
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,706
out a message if you want, click

907
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:50,086
Send, and it'll behave the way

908
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:51,166
you would expect it to.

909
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,486
So, now that we have done all

910
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:55,126
this, let's actually start

911
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:56,956
modifying some of these things.

912
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,136
Now say, for example, that you

913
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,636
took screenshots of these

914
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,006
different pages, and you showed

915
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,006
it to some colleague.

916
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:07,036
And I did something similar, and

917
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:08,636
I got a feedback that said,

918
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,026
''This looks comprehensive, but

919
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:12,716
let's add a few more things.''

920
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,306
So, one of the main feedback was

921
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:16,926
that I should add a new

922
00:26:16,926 --> 00:26:18,836
medication for ibuprofen.

923
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:21,246
Next, they wanted me to add a

924
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,276
new assessment.

925
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:24,416
And then, finally, they also

926
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,926
were a bit critical about the

927
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,186
glyph icon, here, and they

928
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,736
wanted me to switch that out.

929
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:30,326
So, let's see how we can do

930
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:31,106
that.

931
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,546
So, I'm going to go back into

932
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:33,956
XCode.

933
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:36,146
And all the files can be

934
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:36,786
accessed, here.

935
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:39,266
And I can tap on this little

936
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,546
arrow button, here, in order to

937
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:41,136
collapse it.

938
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:42,556
And the files which I am

939
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:43,966
interested in are the PLIST

940
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:44,326
files.

941
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,136
So, there are two files that are

942
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:47,726
available, here, Patient dot

943
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:49,626
plist and Template dot plist.

944
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:51,526
Template, as the name suggests,

945
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:53,566
just has some guidance on what

946
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,876
values you can or cannot use for

947
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:56,626
certain fields.

948
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:58,516
But the file which actually

949
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,196
tells all the tricks behind is

950
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:01,396
Patient dot plist.

951
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:02,966
Now, you notice that there are

952
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,826
five sections available, and

953
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,226
each one corresponds to a

954
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:08,356
specific element in your

955
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:09,006
Prototype app.

956
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:11,596
Now, if I want to add a new

957
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,526
intervention or assessment, the

958
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,326
subsection which I'm interested

959
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:17,176
in the most, is Care Contents.

960
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,616
So, let me go ahead and see what

961
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:19,746
is already available.

962
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,546
So, I collapse it, and there are

963
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:22,926
there items available for me.

964
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:24,856
So, the first one is an

965
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:25,566
intervention.

966
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:26,896
And this is for the

967
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,606
acetaminophen medication, which

968
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,576
you saw in the Prototype app.

969
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,416
The next one is an assessment

970
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,366
for pain.

971
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,546
And the final one is Read Only.

972
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,116
So, in order to start creating a

973
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:42,926
new intervention, the easiest

974
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:44,626
thing to do is to just right

975
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:46,286
click on it and click Copy.

976
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:48,776
And now, I can paste it back

977
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:49,486
right in.

978
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,886
So, here I can go ahead and

979
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:52,866
modify the values.

980
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,266
So, for identifier, they need to

981
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:56,836
be unique across all my

982
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:57,486
activities.

983
00:27:57,706 --> 00:27:59,086
So, in this case, I'm going to

984
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:00,606
just keep it the name of the

985
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:01,746
medication, which I am trying to

986
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:01,976
add.

987
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:03,996
So, the title is going to be

988
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:04,726
Ibuprofen.

989
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,386
The dosage here, is going to be

990
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,596
about 200 milligrams.

991
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,516
And instructions, I can say

992
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:12,096
something like ''Take as

993
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:14,276
needed.'' And one more thing

994
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,606
which I can do is set the tint

995
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:16,626
color of the circles that

996
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:17,036
appear.

997
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,576
So, in this case, let's say I

998
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:19,986
want to set the green color.

999
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:22,116
So, here I can put in a hex

1000
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:22,876
value, directly.

1001
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:23,806
So, I'm going to just try

1002
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:27,146
0x00ff00, which stands for

1003
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:27,416
green.

1004
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,956
And it'll automatically convert

1005
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,636
it to its decimal equivalent.

1006
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,536
And one other important thing

1007
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,196
about adding medications, is

1008
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,636
that you should specify the

1009
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:36,416
schedule, as well.

1010
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:37,966
How many dosages are your

1011
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,306
patients supposed to take, and

1012
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:39,576
when.

1013
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:42,106
That can be specified by going

1014
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:44,046
to the Schedule subsection.

1015
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,376
And under this, you can specify

1016
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,176
the start date and date, as well

1017
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:49,626
as occurrences on each week.

1018
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:50,796
So, I'm going to go to

1019
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:51,506
Occurrences.

1020
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,556
And you'll notice that this

1021
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,736
looks kind of weird.

1022
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:56,306
But this pretty straightforward,

1023
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,226
in the sense that there are

1024
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:58,906
seven elements, here, which map

1025
00:28:58,976 --> 00:29:00,536
to the seven days of the week.

1026
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:02,536
Starting from Sunday all the way

1027
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:03,136
to Saturday.

1028
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,746
So, if I want to prescribe two

1029
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,826
dosages of ibuprofen on every

1030
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,386
single day, I can just change

1031
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:11,906
these values to two on all seven

1032
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:12,156
days.

1033
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,056
And with that, I'm done adding a

1034
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:16,696
new medication to my Prototype

1035
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:16,886
app.

1036
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:18,816
The next thing which I want to

1037
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:20,416
do, is add an assessment.

1038
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:21,796
So, I'm going to follow the same

1039
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,516
routine, where I copy, paste an

1040
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:26,596
existing assessment.

1041
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:28,856
And I'm going to change this to

1042
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:29,266
Mood.

1043
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,316
I want to create the mood of my

1044
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:31,876
patient.

1045
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:34,496
So, here Mood.

1046
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:37,036
Ten being very happy.

1047
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,126
And one more thing you can do,

1048
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,416
when it comes to assessment, is

1049
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,016
that you can leverage the new

1050
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,756
threshold functionality, which

1051
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:47,476
we spoke about.

1052
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,196
So, in this case, what I want to

1053
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:52,056
do, is if my patient enters a

1054
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,746
value which is below a certain

1055
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:55,546
threshold, I want to display

1056
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,546
some sort of an alert to them.

1057
00:29:58,026 --> 00:29:59,326
Which could be very important,

1058
00:29:59,326 --> 00:29:59,976
depending on the scenario.

1059
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,486
So, let's see how that can be

1060
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:02,776
done.

1061
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,606
So, I'm going to click on

1062
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,026
Threshold.

1063
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:06,306
You'll see that there's an item

1064
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,136
available, already.

1065
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:08,816
You can add multiple items to

1066
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:10,076
the same Threshold, as well.

1067
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:11,876
But in this case, I just want

1068
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:12,226
one.

1069
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:15,516
If the value entered by my user

1070
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:20,856
is less than three, I want to

1071
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:22,056
throw an alert that says,

1072
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,406
''Please reduce pain medication

1073
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:31,516
dosages by half.'' And the final

1074
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:32,516
thing which I need to do, is set

1075
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:33,576
the schedule, as well.

1076
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,176
And I want this to repeat once

1077
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:35,596
every day.

1078
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:36,886
Right now, it is repeating on

1079
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:38,116
alternate days of the week.

1080
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:39,866
So, I can just go ahead and

1081
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,406
switch that out, as well.

1082
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:46,346
And that's it.

1083
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,226
So, the final thing which I need

1084
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:49,956
to do, based on my feedback, was

1085
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:51,006
to change the glyph type.

1086
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,576
And looking at the different

1087
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:53,886
subsections, you'll notice that

1088
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:54,856
there's one that says UI

1089
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:55,696
customization.

1090
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:56,746
So, that is probably a good

1091
00:30:56,746 --> 00:30:57,466
place to start.

1092
00:30:58,046 --> 00:30:59,126
And here, you'll notice that

1093
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,966
there is a subsection which says

1094
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:01,936
Care Content UI.

1095
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:04,006
Glyph icons, typically, appear

1096
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:06,616
only in Care Contents view.

1097
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,226
So, I'm going to go ahead and

1098
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:08,756
click on that.

1099
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:10,806
And there is an option available

1100
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:11,506
for glyph type.

1101
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:12,966
Currently, it is pointing to

1102
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:13,456
Home Care.

1103
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:15,526
I'm going to switch this out to

1104
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:16,136
Heart.

1105
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,236
Now, obviously, there are only

1106
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:20,486
certain values that you can

1107
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:21,076
enter, here.

1108
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:23,146
And all those are listed in your

1109
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:24,386
Template dot plist file.

1110
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:26,386
So, you can reference it as you

1111
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,086
are going about it.

1112
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,516
And now that I'm done, I'm just

1113
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:32,316
going to go ahead and click this

1114
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:33,076
Play button, again.

1115
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,396
And let's see what happens.

1116
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,106
So, I have the Simulator, here.

1117
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:38,676
And there you go, my app

1118
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:39,116
launches.

1119
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,906
First thing, you'll notice that

1120
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,396
my glyph icon has changed to

1121
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:42,766
Heart.

1122
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:44,776
There is a new survey.

1123
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:47,006
And you'll notice that there's a

1124
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,656
new ibuprofen medication, as

1125
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:48,886
well.

1126
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:50,336
And it came in the tint color

1127
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:51,986
which I specified it as.

1128
00:31:52,486 --> 00:31:54,236
And once again, you can go ahead

1129
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:55,876
and interact with all of them,

1130
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,276
and they will automatically

1131
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,606
contribute to what's your daily

1132
00:31:58,606 --> 00:31:59,466
goals, as well.

1133
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,296
So, I can go to the Insights tab

1134
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:02,976
and you'll notice that,

1135
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:03,906
currently, there are no

1136
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:05,306
threshold alerts available for

1137
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:05,516
me.

1138
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:08,346
But if I go to my survey, and if

1139
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,626
I enter a value which is less

1140
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:10,126
than three.

1141
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:11,576
So, I'm going to enter two, in

1142
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:12,086
this case.

1143
00:32:12,726 --> 00:32:14,216
And if I go back to Insights,

1144
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:15,286
you'll notice that we have

1145
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:16,926
automatically calculated that,

1146
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:18,296
and we are displaying an alert

1147
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,406
for your patients to view within

1148
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,626
the Prototype app, as well.

1149
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:24,866
And that is the demo for this

1150
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:25,116
tool.

1151
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:32,416
[ Applause ]

1152
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,086
So, you guys saw how easy it is

1153
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:37,206
to create a prototype CareKit

1154
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:40,036
app that is tailor made for your

1155
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:40,956
custom need.

1156
00:32:42,856 --> 00:32:44,666
Now, I would like to go over a

1157
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,686
quick overview of the CareKit

1158
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:47,566
Prototyping Tool.

1159
00:32:48,286 --> 00:32:50,086
And to switch things up, I want

1160
00:32:50,086 --> 00:32:51,766
to start off by acknowledging

1161
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:53,476
some of the limitations of this

1162
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:53,756
tool.

1163
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:56,936
First and foremost, this can be

1164
00:32:56,936 --> 00:32:58,706
used for prototyping only.

1165
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:00,786
There's no way that you can

1166
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,416
build a fully functioning app

1167
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,636
using this tool, which you can

1168
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:06,826
immediately share using the App

1169
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:08,066
Store.

1170
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,976
There's no support for adding

1171
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:10,726
custom views.

1172
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:14,116
And you won't be able to

1173
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:16,166
integrate with any of the

1174
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,076
frameworks which we provide as

1175
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:20,816
part of the Apple ecosystem.

1176
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:23,596
So, for example, if you want to

1177
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:25,146
create the heartrate of your

1178
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:26,716
patient from their Apple Watch

1179
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:28,766
and display that back to them in

1180
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,826
the form of a widget, that is

1181
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:31,896
not something you'll be able to

1182
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:32,916
do using the tool.

1183
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:33,986
You'll be able to create a

1184
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:35,496
mockup of that, but not the

1185
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:36,626
actual implementation.

1186
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,526
And now, let's deal with some of

1187
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,086
the features for this tool.

1188
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:44,506
You could be a physician or a

1189
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:45,526
PhD student.

1190
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:47,126
You'll be able to pick up and

1191
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:48,786
start using this tool without

1192
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:50,336
having to write any code, at

1193
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,586
all.

1194
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,366
The second thing, is that you

1195
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,426
can create multiple PLISTs and

1196
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,826
switch between them, thus

1197
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,536
allowing for rapid prototyping.

1198
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,126
And because the CareKit

1199
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:01,976
framework is opensource, if you

1200
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:03,496
have created a PLIST for your

1201
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:04,876
custom case and if you want to

1202
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,516
share it with the community, you

1203
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:07,486
can do that, as well.

1204
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,876
It is highly customizable,

1205
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:11,996
because we have applied this

1206
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,005
mapping approach throughout the

1207
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:14,906
CareKit framework.

1208
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:17,606
And finally, if you are a

1209
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:19,676
developer, and if you are really

1210
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:20,916
interested in any of the

1211
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,335
features we spoke about, today.

1212
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:23,906
And you want to try it out for

1213
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:26,065
yourself, you can give it a spin

1214
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,456
using the CareKit Prototyping

1215
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,686
Tool.

1216
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,406
And then, make an informed

1217
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,196
decision as to whether or not

1218
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,926
you want to incorporate this as

1219
00:34:32,926 --> 00:34:34,626
part of your app.

1220
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:35,886
And for the designers out there,

1221
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,416
if you have created brand new

1222
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,186
assets, you can plug them into

1223
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:40,735
the project in the Assets

1224
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:41,226
catalog.

1225
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:43,536
And then, reference them using a

1226
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:46,386
PLIST file, and build the apps

1227
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,976
which can run across multiple

1228
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:48,636
devices.

1229
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:51,156
And all this can be done without

1230
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,356
having to write any code.

1231
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:57,506
We really hope that this tool

1232
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,366
can help bridge the gap between

1233
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:01,386
the nontechnical audience and

1234
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:04,156
our amazing and vibrant iOS app

1235
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:05,086
developer community.

1236
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,576
In such a way that it can spur

1237
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:09,096
innovation in the field of

1238
00:35:09,096 --> 00:35:10,906
healthcare centric apps that can

1239
00:35:10,906 --> 00:35:12,896
have a meaningful and lasting

1240
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,496
impact on the lives of our

1241
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:15,136
users.

1242
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:17,126
And with that, back to you, Sam.

1243
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:18,896
>> Thank you, Srinath.

1244
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,126
So, we're super excited about

1245
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:21,856
tools like these.

1246
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,056
We think they can really

1247
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:24,396
accelerate the learning and the

1248
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:26,066
community, and bring your ideas

1249
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:27,236
for CareKit apps to life, that

1250
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:27,926
much faster.

1251
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:29,886
So, with that, I'd like to go

1252
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:30,846
ahead and start wrapping up out

1253
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:32,386
talk, now, by reminding all of

1254
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:33,926
you that ResearchKit and CareKit

1255
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:34,946
are opensource.

1256
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:36,276
And so, that means that they

1257
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:38,256
truly are what we make of it.

1258
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:42,626
Yes. So, we are so excited about

1259
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,066
your participation, so far.

1260
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:45,726
And of course, we have some

1261
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,156
ideas and suggestions of where

1262
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:48,316
we think that these could go,

1263
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:48,796
together.

1264
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,016
So, first off, up until this

1265
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,426
point, ResearchKit and CareKit

1266
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:54,496
has focused solely on the

1267
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,816
participants and the patients.

1268
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,496
But we understand that all this

1269
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,066
new data flowing through from

1270
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,876
these populations is extremely

1271
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:02,876
valuable to both researchers and

1272
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:03,486
care teams.

1273
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,136
And so, that means it's really

1274
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,406
important for all of us to start

1275
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:07,636
thinking about the best way to

1276
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,366
visualize this population data

1277
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:10,376
for researchers.

1278
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,466
So, that way they can gain the

1279
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:12,516
most insights from their

1280
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:13,266
research studies.

1281
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:15,086
As well as for care teams, that

1282
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:16,486
way they understand how to best

1283
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:18,406
monitor or update care plans

1284
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:19,556
based on their patient data.

1285
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:22,626
Additionally, if you start to

1286
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:23,996
build hooks into your apps, that

1287
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:24,956
let them integrate with

1288
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:26,136
different EMR systems.

1289
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,546
We would love for you to build

1290
00:36:27,546 --> 00:36:28,726
those hooks in such a way that

1291
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:29,716
you can bring them back to the

1292
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:30,286
community.

1293
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,866
And let others leverage these

1294
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:32,596
capabilities.

1295
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:34,936
And lastly, we feel that there's

1296
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,876
always room to build new modules

1297
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:38,306
for both of our frameworks.

1298
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:39,646
And these modules could support

1299
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:40,946
things like rich educational

1300
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:42,956
content or social networking and

1301
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:44,086
community platforms.

1302
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:45,156
That way, participants and

1303
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:46,306
patients can connect with each

1304
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:46,596
other.

1305
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:48,226
As well as different reward

1306
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:49,686
systems, so that way, users can

1307
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:51,286
better understand their progress

1308
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,676
or engagement within your app.

1309
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:55,496
And so, then, I know you guys

1310
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:56,706
all have ideas, as well.

1311
00:36:56,836 --> 00:36:58,186
And once you start developing

1312
00:36:58,186 --> 00:36:59,186
these features and feel like

1313
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:00,236
they're in the place that you

1314
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:01,056
want to bring it back to the

1315
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,636
community.

1316
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,026
Then that's where our team will

1317
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:04,256
step in and then work with you

1318
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:06,086
to enhance that feature and get

1319
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:07,266
it ready for our next release.

1320
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,036
And we'll do that by providing

1321
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,776
you with accessibility testing,

1322
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:13,356
as well as localization and QA

1323
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,906
testing across all of our

1324
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:16,496
supported devices and platforms.

1325
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,046
And once, we feel like the

1326
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,026
feature is ready and we've

1327
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:20,226
worked with you to get it there,

1328
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:21,606
we will then, merge it into the

1329
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,996
framework and get it ready for

1330
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:23,706
