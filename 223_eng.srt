1
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,626
>> Good morning.

2
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,986
Welcome to Drag and Drop with

3
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:27,436
collection and table view.

4
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:29,016
I'm Tyler Fox.

5
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,106
I'll later be joined by my

6
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,536
colleague Mohammed Jisrawi.

7
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:32,996
And unfortunately our

8
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,506
co-presenter Steve Breen had a

9
00:00:34,506 --> 00:00:36,116
last minute medical emergency

10
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:38,686
earlier this week, so he's been

11
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,216
an amazing trooper and has been

12
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:41,786
recovering quickly but

13
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:42,776
unfortunately can't join us on

14
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,366
stage today.

15
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:44,576
So just a quick round of

16
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:45,586
applause, because he contributed

17
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,666
a lot to the stuff we're going

18
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,956
to talk about today.

19
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:52,876
So with that, let's talk about

20
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:54,446
Drag and Drop in collection and

21
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:55,306
table views.

22
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,466
We built a nice little app to

23
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:00,006
showcase some of the ways that

24
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:01,506
you can use Drag and Drop in

25
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:02,576
collection and table view.

26
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:04,706
In this app, it's a nice photo

27
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,276
library where we have albums and

28
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:07,546
photos in each of those albums,

29
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,146
and you can drag photos around

30
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,416
from one album to another.

31
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,736
You can even actually drop them

32
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:14,396
directly into that table view of

33
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:15,416
each of the albums.

34
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,436
And you can reorder photos

35
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,026
within the actual collection

36
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:19,396
views.

37
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,066
So we're going to show you how

38
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,546
you can actually use our new

39
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:24,886
APIs and iOS 11 to add Drag and

40
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:25,976
Drop to collection and table

41
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:28,446
views in all of your apps.

42
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,476
Now, you've probably been to

43
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,686
some of the sessions earlier

44
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:33,876
this week about all of this new

45
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,706
great API that we have in UIKit

46
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:36,486
for Drag and Drop.

47
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,966
So we have this great new drag

48
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,576
interaction and drop interaction

49
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:41,506
API layer.

50
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,296
We have new enhancements to NS

51
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,796
item provider in iOS 11, but

52
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,236
today, we're going to focus on

53
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:48,216
UICollectionView and

54
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,526
UITtableView, of course.

55
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,446
And we have new higher level

56
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,666
APIs specific for those classes.

57
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,226
So you might be wondering why do

58
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:57,916
we need new APIs just for

59
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,166
collection and table view?

60
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:00,516
It's a great question.

61
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,446
We wanted to build some specific

62
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,246
APIs that are focused around

63
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,996
cells and index paths.

64
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,216
As you know, collection and

65
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:10,045
table view are composite views

66
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,826
that build up a lot of smaller

67
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:13,276
cells to display on screen.

68
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:15,556
And so we realized we can help

69
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,936
you out a lot by speaking in

70
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,616
those native cell and index path

71
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:19,956
terms that you're familiar with.

72
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,756
We also wanted to make it easy

73
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,456
to build fluid animations and

74
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,656
get consistent behavior with

75
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:26,886
your collection and table views

76
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:27,836
across the system.

77
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,396
And we also recognized there are

78
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,006
some specific challenges with

79
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:33,456
collection and table view to

80
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:34,716
handle a synchronous data

81
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:35,106
loading.

82
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:36,396
We have some really cool new

83
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:37,516
stuff that we're really excited

84
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:38,456
to share with you later in the

85
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:38,916
session.

86
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,876
Finally I'd like to make a note

87
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:42,936
that throughout this talk we're

88
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,536
going to be showing examples of

89
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,826
collection view and table view

90
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:47,976
code but you should know that we

91
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,796
have a consistent API for both

92
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,056
of these classes, so sometimes

93
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,046
we're going to show one or the

94
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,696
other and you should know that

95
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:54,746
[inaudible] some small naming

96
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,146
differences, everything applies

97
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,006
equally to both.

98
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,306
We'll call out the differences

99
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:58,986
when there are some.

100
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,716
With that, let's go through our

101
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:01,436
agenda for today.

102
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:03,476
We're going to start by covering

103
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,376
the basics.

104
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:05,846
How you can very quickly just

105
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,116
get Drag and Drop up and running

106
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:08,406
in collection and table views.

107
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,716
And then we're going to focus on

108
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:12,106
perfecting drops.

109
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:13,666
With just a little bit more

110
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,816
work, you can make your Drag and

111
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,296
Drop experience in collection

112
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,356
and table view just look

113
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:18,966
awesome.

114
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:19,806
And we'll show you some really

115
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,606
cool animations you can add and

116
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:22,556
a whole bunch of great stuff.

117
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,386
And finally we'll talk about

118
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,486
final touches, some really nice

119
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,136
customizations and additional

120
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:28,926
things that you can take

121
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,346
advantage of to make that

122
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:31,636
experience really shine.

123
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:33,606
To start, I'd like to bring up

124
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:35,286
Mohammed to tell you all about

125
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,636
the basics of getting Drag and

126
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:37,806
Drop in your collection and

127
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:38,426
table views.

128
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:38,976
Mohammed.

129
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:44,636
[ Applause ]

130
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:45,746
>> Thanks Tyler.

131
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,576
We wanted to make adopting Drag

132
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,176
and Drop in your apps with

133
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,206
collection and table view as

134
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,256
easy as possible.

135
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:54,336
So to help you do that we're

136
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,446
introducing two new delegates on

137
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,166
both collection and table view.

138
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,946
The first is the dragDelegate,

139
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,566
which has methods for initiating

140
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,926
and customizing drags.

141
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,596
And second is the dropDelegate,

142
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:11,286
which has methods for completing

143
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:11,596
drags.

144
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,416
So basically data transfer,

145
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,826
customizing drop animations,

146
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:17,125
things like that.

147
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,966
It's important to note that

148
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,116
these two protocols are

149
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,586
completely independent.

150
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:25,176
You can use one or the other, if

151
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,276
you want one-half of the

152
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:29,916
experience or you can use both

153
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,736
to have both Drag and Drop.

154
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,706
Using both also unlocks

155
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,136
additional functionality like

156
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,846
reordering within your

157
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:38,096
collection or table view.

158
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,906
Implementing drags is pretty

159
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,566
straightforward.

160
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:45,156
You conform to dragDelegate and

161
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:49,196
implement one required method.

162
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,956
Items for beginning session at

163
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,866
index paths is called when the

164
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,676
user initiates a drag out of

165
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:55,516
your collection view, so

166
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:56,346
basically when they start

167
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,376
dragging a cell.

168
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:01,116
It's the app's responsibility to

169
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,706
use the input session and index

170
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:06,716
path to figure out how to handle

171
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:07,486
that drag.

172
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,236
So returning an array of

173
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,346
UIDragItems initiates the drag,

174
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,046
whereas returning an empty array

175
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:16,976
causes the drag to be ignored.

176
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,396
You might remember that tapping

177
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,256
other items, or other views, in

178
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,116
your app to add them to a drag

179
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,246
that's already in progress is a

180
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:28,956
key experience of Drag and Drop

181
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:29,606
on iOS.

182
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,776
Opting into this behavior in

183
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:34,146
collection and table view is

184
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,166
really easy.

185
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:37,786
There's an optional method on

186
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,676
dragDelegate that's called

187
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:41,846
whenever you tap a cell in the

188
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:44,226
collection view while a drag

189
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:45,486
session's already in progress.

190
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:48,096
Items for adding to session at

191
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,966
index path point gives you the

192
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:52,656
opportunity to return drag items

193
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,206
to add to your in-progress drag.

194
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,296
Returning an empty array from

195
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,786
this method causes the tap to be

196
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:00,646
handled normally.

197
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:02,476
So it could be interpreted as a

198
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:03,976
cell selection, for example.

199
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,496
Accepting a drop is equally

200
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:10,816
easy.

201
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,256
Similar to the dragDelegate,

202
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,776
there's a single required method

203
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:15,976
to get you started.

204
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,206
Perform drop with coordinator

205
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,686
gets called when the user lifts

206
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,056
their finger over your

207
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,386
collection view releasing the

208
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,316
dragged items.

209
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,726
This method gives you the

210
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:31,206
opportunity to handle the drop

211
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,446
using the drop coordinator.

212
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:35,386
The drop coordinator provides a

213
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:36,906
lot of convenience methods for

214
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,486
you for doing things like

215
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,086
accessing the dropped items so

216
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:42,196
you can actually perform the

217
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:43,126
data transfer.

218
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,216
It gives you some really great

219
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:47,916
convenience methods for updating

220
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,616
your collection and table view.

221
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:54,716
And finally it gives you some

222
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,366
ways to specify some default

223
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,166
system animations for your drop.

224
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:02,736
So now that we've talked about

225
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,126
how easy it is to adopt Drag and

226
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,386
Drop in your collection table

227
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:06,626
views, let's take a look at it

228
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:06,976
with a demo.

229
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,706
So I'm going to start out with a

230
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,586
basic gallery application that

231
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:21,836
uses a collection view to

232
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:23,436
display a grid of photos.

233
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:24,456
And we're going to add the

234
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,186
ability to drag images out of

235
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,486
the collection view and to

236
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,226
import images back in by

237
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:32,036
dropping them from other apps.

238
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,326
So, as you see, I've already

239
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:35,106
started with kind of a stub

240
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:35,966
implementation of

241
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,486
itemsForBeginning Session at

242
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:38,726
IndexPath.

243
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,936
And I'm just going to add some

244
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:45,266
basic code that goes to our data

245
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:48,916
source, retrieves a photo model

246
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,466
object, and then pulls out a UI

247
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,666
image from this photo using our

248
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:54,796
image property.

249
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,106
Since UI image already conforms

250
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,356
to NSItemProvider writing, we

251
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:00,906
can just use it to create an

252
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:01,816
NSItemProvider.

253
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,026
For your own model object, if

254
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:04,806
you're dragging something other

255
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,806
than images, you'll have to make

256
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:07,976
sure that those objects conform

257
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:09,046
to NSItemProvider writing.

258
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,016
There's a great session about

259
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,016
that just after this.

260
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:13,856
Once we have the NSItemProvider,

261
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:15,026
we can use it to create a

262
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,036
UIDragItem which will return to

263
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:18,626
the system to start the drag.

264
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,136
So I'm good to go to start

265
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,576
dragging things, but I also want

266
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,076
to add the ability to flock

267
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,876
things to my in progress drag,

268
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:26,676
so I'm going to add an

269
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:28,436
implementation of items for

270
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,506
adding to session at IndexPath,

271
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:30,976
point.

272
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,106
And I'm just going to do the

273
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:33,356
same thing that I did in my

274
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,126
itemsForBeginning Session method

275
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,806
to just return a bunch of drag

276
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:38,246
items.

277
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,265
So let's build this real quick

278
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:40,976
and see what it looks like.

279
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:49,616
So I'm going to pull up the

280
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,626
photos app and pin it next to my

281
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:53,866
gallery app.

282
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:55,936
You'll see that I can now start

283
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,036
dragging things out of my

284
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,306
collection view, and, if I tap

285
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,086
some of these other cells, they

286
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,686
flock over to my in-progress

287
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,186
drag, and I can carry them over

288
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:09,486
to photos and let go to drop.

289
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:11,286
So now that we have dragging

290
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:12,546
items, let's look at adding --

291
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,746
accepting drops.

292
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:16,656
So, as we discussed earlier,

293
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,866
we'll have to implement the one

294
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,396
required method on collection

295
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,236
view dropDelegate,

296
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,446
performDropWith Coordinator.

297
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:24,966
Here we're going to take

298
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,366
advantage of the coordinator's

299
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,156
convenience methods to get some

300
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:29,716
information about the drop and

301
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:30,866
then actually perform it.

302
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:32,906
The first thing we'll want to do

303
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,656
is ask the coordinator for the

304
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,206
destination index path.

305
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,446
This IndexPath is derived from

306
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,626
the point at which the user

307
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,346
releases the dragged items.

308
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:44,616
Since that point could be over a

309
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,756
region of the collection or

310
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,166
table view that's completely

311
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,686
empty, it could be nil.

312
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,386
So we'll just handle that case

313
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:53,076
here by returning a zero zero

314
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:53,866
and inserting it at the --

315
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,356
inserting it at the beginning of

316
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,296
our collection view.

317
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:01,306
Next, we're going to take

318
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,446
advantage of a convenience

319
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,546
method on the drop session to

320
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,146
load all objects of a specific

321
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:07,896
class in the scenario UI image.

322
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:08,816
That's what we're interested in.

323
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,126
And then in load objects'

324
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,966
completion closure we'll update

325
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:14,976
our collection view, like we

326
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,116
normally would, by calling

327
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,666
perform match updates with some

328
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,926
data source updates using a

329
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,836
convenience method that we've

330
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,136
written in the past.

331
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,096
And we'll ask the collection

332
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,596
view to reload the first

333
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:27,196
section.

334
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,976
So let's give that a quick try.

335
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,886
So now I'm going to pick up a

336
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:41,576
couple of these photos from the

337
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:43,326
photo's app and I'm going to

338
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,356
just drop them over my

339
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:48,066
collection view to accept the

340
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:48,406
drop.

341
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:53,266
So I can pick up some items from

342
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,746
photos actually this time.

343
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,596
Go back over to my app and let

344
00:10:57,596 --> 00:10:58,716
go to accept the drop.

So now that we've actually seen

348
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,336
what it looks like [laughter],

349
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,076
just by adding a couple of

350
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:13,306
methods, it was easy to get

351
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:13,686
started.

352
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:15,586
Now Tyler is going to talk about

353
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,256
how we can build some really

354
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,596
awesome drop animations.

00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:25,486
Thanks Mohammed.

358
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,486
All right.

359
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:27,926
So let's turn our attention to

360
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,276
really focus in now on

361
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,016
perfecting these drops.

362
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,866
And I'll start by talking about

363
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:34,596
something called a drop

364
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,066
proposal.

365
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:36,736
So if you've been to some of the

366
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,326
earlier sessions on the other

367
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:39,256
APIs that are available in

368
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:40,416
UIKit, this might be familiar.

369
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,576
But a drop proposal is your way

370
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,376
to communicate to the system how

371
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:45,616
you'd like to handle the drop

372
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,186
session before the user actually

373
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:48,786
releases their touch to perform

374
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:49,416
the drop.

375
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,046
The system is going to ask you

376
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,676
to create and return a drop

377
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,526
proposal multiple times while

378
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:55,966
the user is dragging over the

379
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:56,866
collection or table view.

380
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,066
Now collection and table view,

381
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,836
each have subclasses of

382
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,716
UIDropProposal, and, as a

383
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:03,786
result, that means they each

384
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,176
have that same property that

385
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:06,726
comes from UIDropProposal, which

386
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,536
is an operation.

387
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,176
So this is a value like copy,

388
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,906
move, cancel, or forbidden, and

389
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,376
generally indicates whether or

390
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:15,866
not you're interested in this

391
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,906
particular drop session and how

392
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:19,306
you intend to handle the actual

393
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,876
data inside of that drop

394
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:21,246
session.

395
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,516
But collection and table view

396
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:25,146
drop proposals don't stop there.

397
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,576
They also have an additional

398
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,706
value, which is a drop intent.

399
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:30,026
What is this?

400
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:31,816
This is some additional

401
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,136
information that your app can

402
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,506
provide to the collection or

403
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:36,346
table view which will let the

404
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:37,246
collection or table view

405
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,866
actually update their appearance

406
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,546
during the drop session to

407
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:43,296
reflect what you intend to do.

408
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:44,886
So let's look at some of the

409
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:46,366
actual values for this drop

410
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,926
intent to understand it better.

411
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:49,886
We will start with the default

412
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,826
one, which is the drop intent

413
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:52,646
unspecified.

414
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,156
With this drop intent,

415
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,706
collection or table view won't

416
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:58,246
actually change their appearance

417
00:12:58,246 --> 00:12:59,726
at all during the drop session.

418
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:00,996
As you can see here, when the

419
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,426
user's dragging around over it,

420
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,266
there's just a nice little badge

421
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,016
next to the drag preview and

422
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:06,586
that's it.

423
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:07,976
You might choose this drop

424
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:09,356
intent if you don't yet know,

425
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,686
for example, where the items

426
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:11,906
will end up when the user

427
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,056
actually realizes their finger

428
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:13,886
to perform the drop.

429
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,866
Or perhaps the drag session

430
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,626
contains a mix of items, where

431
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:18,676
they're going to end up in

432
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:20,036
different locations when the

433
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:21,076
actual drop occurs.

434
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:23,266
So that's the first drop intent.

435
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:23,986
Unspecified.

436
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:25,936
The second drop intent is

437
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:28,026
insertAtDestinationIndexPath.

438
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,406
With this drop intent, it means

439
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:32,016
that you intend to insert a new

440
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:33,496
item or row into the collection

441
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,076
or table view at the destination

442
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:35,956
index path.

443
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,676
And, as you can see, collection

444
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:38,656
and table view will actually

445
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,776
open up a gap at this location

446
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,136
to let the user know that's the

447
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,336
location where their drop will

448
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:43,966
be accepted.

449
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,176
The third drop intent is

450
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:49,386
insertIntoDestinationIndexPath.

451
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,476
This is something that you want

452
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,256
to use when the user is dragging

453
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:56,426
over a cell that represents some

454
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,176
sort of container of items.

455
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,266
For example, here we have photo

456
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:02,396
albums, containers of photos, or

457
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:04,026
maybe you have a folder cell or

458
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:04,866
a list cell.

459
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,856
In this case, you intend to

460
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:09,016
insert the dropped items inside

461
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:09,796
of that container.

462
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:11,776
And so, table view, for example,

463
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,276
is going to highlight the row at

464
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:14,546
the destination index path so

465
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:15,986
the user knows that the drop

466
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,356
will be accepted inside that

467
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:17,616
row.

468
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,926
Now there's one more drop intent

469
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,426
value which is specific to

470
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,186
UITableView and that's the

471
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:25,746
automatic drop intent.

472
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:27,656
This is something that you

473
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:28,986
should use instead of

474
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,306
insertIntoDestinationIndexPath.

475
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,246
And this drop intent means that

476
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,996
you can either drop into an

477
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:37,006
existing container row at that

478
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,996
index path or you could move the

479
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,046
container row down out of the

480
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,876
way and insert a new row into

481
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,276
the table view at the same index

482
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:43,706
path.

483
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,056
And table view is going to

484
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,866
automatically tell you, when the

485
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,536
drop occurs, which one it is.

486
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:49,386
It'll pick between

487
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,616
insertAtDestinationIndexPath and

488
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,316
insertIntoDestinationIndexPath

489
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:53,786
for you.

490
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:56,626
So let's look at an example of

491
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,736
how you can provide a drop

492
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:58,676
proposal in code.

493
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,756
It starts by implementing this

494
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:01,536
optional method,

495
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:02,886
dropSessionDidUpdate,

496
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:04,286
withDestinationIndexPath.

497
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,426
Here this will be called

498
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,126
whenever the table view or

499
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:09,406
collection view detects that

500
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:10,496
there's a drop session moving

501
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:11,436
over it.

502
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:12,926
Now this method is optional, but

503
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,196
we strongly recommend that you

504
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,396
implement it because this is how

505
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:16,786
you provide your drop proposal.

506
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,326
Now because this is called all

507
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,486
the time when the collection or

508
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,876
table view sees a drop session

509
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:22,986
over it and whenever that drop

510
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,446
session moves, it's going to be

511
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:25,316
called very frequently.

512
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,036
And so your implementation needs

513
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,316
to be very efficient and return

514
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:30,276
quickly to avoid hanging the

515
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,036
main thread.

516
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:33,576
Now I'd like to call your

517
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:34,306
attention to this

518
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,556
destinationIndexPath that's

519
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,126
passed in.

520
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:37,906
Once again, this is our proposal

521
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,376
of where we think that you would

522
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:41,426
like to insert any items into

523
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:42,346
the collection or table view.

524
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:45,086
Now this destinationIndexPath

525
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,856
will be nil in some cases.

526
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,536
In particular, when the user's

527
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:50,096
dragging over a region of the

528
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,066
collection or table view where

529
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,216
there are no cells.

530
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:54,656
And another very important point

531
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:56,086
about this that might trip you

532
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,176
up, so be careful.

533
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:59,306
When the user drags over the end

534
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,926
of an existing section in the

535
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,846
collection or table view.

536
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,026
This index path might be equal

537
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,606
to the count of the number of

538
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,116
items in that section, which

539
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,846
means it may not correspond to

540
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,096
an existing item in that

541
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:10,576
section.

542
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,146
So be careful because that's an

543
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,406
insert at the very end of the

544
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:13,816
section.

545
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:16,326
So let's look at a quick example

546
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:17,396
of how you could implement this.

547
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:18,846
In this example, we'll look at

548
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:20,696
the local drag session property

549
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,436
on the drop session to see if

550
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,146
the drag originated from our app

551
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:24,576
or not.

552
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,226
If it's from our app, we can use

553
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,066
a drop operation of move and

554
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:29,436
otherwise we'll use a drop

555
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:30,466
operation of copy.

556
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:31,986
Both cases here we're going to

557
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,046
insert a new item into the

558
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:34,156
collection view, so we'll use

559
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:36,456
insertAtDestinationIndexPath as

560
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,076
our intent.

561
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:40,156
Okay. So that's drop proposals

562
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:41,406
which you provide while the

563
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:42,816
user's still dragging over the

564
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:43,676
collection or table view.

565
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,576
Let's switch gears now to talk

566
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,056
about dropping when the user

567
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,466
actually releases their touch

568
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:49,556
and you need to perform the

569
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:49,856
drop.

570
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,846
To set up some great animations,

571
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:54,496
you can use the drop coordinator

572
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,016
that we pass in to perform drop

573
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:56,686
with coordinator.

574
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:58,966
Collection and table view will

575
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,486
provide some basic animations by

576
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,466
default if you do nothing.

577
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:03,676
But for the best effects, you

578
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:04,915
can use the drop coordinator to

579
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,986
set up specific animations for

580
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:08,886
each item independently in the

581
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:09,576
drop session.

582
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,306
Let's look at some of the

583
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:12,056
methods that we've made

584
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,746
available for you to do that.

585
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,965
The first one is dropping to an

586
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:17,736
item or row.

587
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:20,465
This is a drop animation that

588
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,836
you'll use with the intent

589
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,756
insertAtDestinationIndexPath.

590
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:25,846
And you want to use this when

591
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,256
you've already performed an

592
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,386
update to insert a new item or

593
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:30,606
row into the collection or table

594
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:30,826
view.

595
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,676
So let's look at an example in

596
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,786
code to see how we can implement

597
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:33,976
this.

598
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,206
Inside of performDropWith

599
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,696
coordinator, we need to start by

600
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:41,786
gathering up a few local

601
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:42,856
variables that we need.

602
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,026
In particular, we'll need our

603
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:46,046
destinationIndexPath, and we'll

604
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,736
also use the local object

605
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,476
property on the drag item to

606
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,326
actually get at the underlying

607
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,306
data synchronously.

608
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,166
This is something that you can

609
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,806
do when the drag session starts

610
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,426
from your own app.

611
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,666
Next, because we have that data

612
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,926
right away we can perform an

613
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,326
immediate insertion into our

614
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,436
collection view, so we'll call

615
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:03,526
performBatchUpdates.

616
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:04,986
And inside, of course, we'll do

617
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,616
the usual update of our data

618
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,846
source incorporating that new

619
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:08,316
image.

620
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,806
And we'll insert an item in the

621
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:10,366
collection view.

622
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:12,386
And now, because we've actually

623
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:14,166
already inserted that cell, we

624
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,886
can tell the drop coordinator to

625
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,356
drop the item to that specific

626
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:19,766
cell at that index path.

627
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:20,916
This is going to set up that

628
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,246
nice animation you saw where the

629
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:23,856
drag preview morphs right to the

630
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,086
final cell that we inserted.

631
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,336
All right.

632
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,416
The next drop animation is

633
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,306
dropping into an item or row.

634
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:33,136
As you might imagine, this is

635
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,536
generally used with the intent

636
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,656
insertIntoDestinationIndexPath.

637
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,536
In this case, we're inserting

638
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:40,146
the item inside of a container

639
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:40,846
cell.

640
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:43,326
And so the item is going -- we

641
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:44,206
want the animation to kind of

642
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,146
scale down with this nice

643
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:47,626
animation right to some region

644
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,856
inside of that cell to show the

645
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,186
user where this drop was

646
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:50,846
accepted.

647
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:52,626
So let's look at an example of

648
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,006
how we could set this one up in

649
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:54,516
some code.

650
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:56,856
Once again, we're back in our

651
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:59,676
performDropWith coordinator and

652
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,246
we have basically the same code

653
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:01,986
here that you saw from the

654
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:02,886
previous example.

655
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,606
So just gathering up our

656
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:05,906
destinationIndexPath and the

657
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,526
image that actually was in the

658
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:08,236
drag session.

659
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,496
Now there's one additional check

660
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:11,756
that we do want to do, in this

661
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:13,206
case, which is to make sure that

662
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:14,646
that destinationIndexPath

663
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,606
corresponds to an actual row in

664
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:17,216
our table view.

665
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:18,796
Otherwise, we can't drop into

666
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,096
anything in that album.

667
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:21,946
If it does, we can actually

668
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,726
incorporate the data inside the

669
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,056
underlying data structure for

670
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:25,846
that photo album.

671
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,816
And then we're ready to set up

672
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:28,506
our animation.

673
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,436
So, in this case, we'll get the

674
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,756
cell for that particular row and

675
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:33,556
we're going to animate to the

676
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:34,406
image view in that cell.

677
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,396
So we'll get the image view.

678
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,416
Then we call coordinator drop

679
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,006
item IntoRowAt index path rect.

680
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:41,586
We're passing a rect that it's

681
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:42,816
in the coordinate space of the

682
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,636
cell, so we translate that image

683
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,746
view's bounds up to the cell's

684
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,376
coordinate space.

685
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:49,856
So to recap.

686
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,086
Now, we've talked about two drop

687
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:51,546
animations.

688
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:52,816
We have dropping to a newly

689
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,546
inserted cell.

690
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,866
We have dropping to a rect

691
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,066
inside a container cell.

692
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,076
There's a third drop animation

693
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,656
method available which is

694
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:01,746
dropping to a target.

695
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:03,516
This is how you can perform

696
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:04,976
completely custom animations.

697
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:06,446
For example, animating to a

698
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,096
location anywhere in your app

699
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,366
with an optional transform.

700
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:11,116
So maybe you want to animate to

701
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:12,686
a tab bar or bar button item or

702
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:13,386
something like that.

703
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,636
Those are the three basic drop

704
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:16,326
animations.

705
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,006
But I'd like to step back to the

706
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:20,206
first one that we talked about

707
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:21,676
and revisit that just for a

708
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:21,936
second.

709
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,376
Dropping to a newly inserted

710
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,016
item or row.

711
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:26,306
As we've discussed, you actually

712
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,746
need to already have performed

713
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:28,826
the update on the collection or

714
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,176
table view to insert that new

715
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:31,576
cell before you can use this

716
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:31,936
method.

717
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:33,576
But what if the data hasn't

718
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:34,076
loaded yet?

719
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:37,846
If you're dragging between

720
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,416
applications on iOS, we always

721
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,086
have an asynchronous data load.

722
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,676
But these animations need to be

723
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,016
specified immediately before you

724
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,296
return from performDropWith

725
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:48,796
coordinator.

726
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,366
So to solve for that, that would

727
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,456
mean you'd have to do some

728
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:53,616
pretty difficult bookkeeping,

729
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:54,696
because you're going to have to

730
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:56,196
do temporary insertions in the

731
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:57,556
collection or table view, just

732
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,856
to set up these animations.

733
00:20:59,126 --> 00:20:59,916
Which, of course, would mean

734
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,046
updating your data source with

735
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,796
temporary model objects, and

736
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:03,816
that's not going to be easy.

737
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:05,526
Remember these asynchronous

738
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:06,846
loads can even come in out of

739
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:07,246
order.

740
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,256
We know this is a big challenge,

741
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,366
and we are extremely excited to

742
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:13,596
tell you about brand new

743
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,566
technology in iOS 11 for

744
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,606
collection and table view,

745
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:17,996
specifically designed for this

746
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:18,556
problem.

747
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:19,636
I'd like to introduce

748
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:19,976
placeholders.

749
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:25,086
[ Applause ]

750
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,046
Okay. What are placeholders?

751
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:28,506
So, as the name suggests, these

752
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:29,946
are temporary items or rows that

753
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,156
you insert into your collection

754
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:31,776
or table view.

755
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:33,816
And the key thing about them is

756
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,506
that you can defer updating your

757
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:36,966
data source until the data

758
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,656
finishes loading when you insert

759
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:39,376
placeholders.

760
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:41,866
So for placeholders, you can use

761
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:42,976
any cell that you want.

762
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,376
You can provide it to us.

763
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:45,656
We'll do all the difficult

764
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,376
bookkeeping on the back end

765
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:48,466
until your data finishes

766
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:48,796
loading.

767
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:50,806
The way this works is that

768
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:51,936
collection and table view will

769
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,656
never actually call out to ask

770
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:54,886
your delegate or data source

771
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,706
about placeholders, so your

772
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,246
delegates can remain blissfully

773
00:21:58,246 --> 00:21:59,726
unaware that they even exist.

774
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,756
You can insert as many

775
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:02,956
placeholders as you want,

776
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:03,806
anywhere you want in the

777
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,126
collection or table view, and

778
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,866
you can even perform incremental

779
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,806
updates while placeholders exist

780
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,956
to put new rows or items in the

781
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,006
collection view, table view, or

782
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:13,076
move some existing one.

783
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:14,176
Anything like that.

784
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:15,766
So this provides users with a

785
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,156
great experience while their

786
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:18,496
data is loading across

787
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:19,986
applications, because you can

788
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:21,526
keep your user interface live

789
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,096
and responsive during these data

790
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:23,616
transfers.

791
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,036
So how do you create

792
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:25,736
placeholders?

793
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:27,616
Well, you're creating them using

794
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:28,936
the drop coordinator, of course.

795
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:31,056
To insert and animate it to a

796
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:31,586
placeholder.

797
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:32,946
Let's dive into some code and

798
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:33,516
see how it's done.

799
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,496
So we're back in our

800
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:36,646
performDropWith coordinator

801
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,096
method.

802
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:38,266
Again, we'll need a

803
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,686
destinationIndexPath that we're

804
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:40,926
actually going to drop to.

805
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:42,986
And now here we do things a

806
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,796
little bit differently.

807
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,536
Now we're going to iterate over

808
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:46,856
each of the items in the drop

809
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:48,886
session independently and for

810
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:50,676
each item, we're going to insert

811
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:51,226
a placeholder.

812
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,736
So we call coordinator drop item

813
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:55,316
toPlaceholderInsertedAt index

814
00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:56,696
path withReuseIdentifier.

815
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:58,716
This will actually insert a

816
00:22:58,716 --> 00:22:59,516
placeholder at the

817
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,096
destinationIndexPath for this

818
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:01,886
particular item.

819
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:03,576
You'll notice we pass over use

820
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:04,096
identifier.

821
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,066
This is something that you've

822
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,356
already registered with the

823
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:07,796
collection or table view and

824
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:08,786
we're going to use that to

825
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:10,056
dequeue a cell for this

826
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:10,586
placeholder.

827
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,986
You'll also notice, of course,

828
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:13,856
that there's a closure at the

829
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:15,446
end and that there's a comment

830
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:16,596
configure your placeholder cell

831
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:16,826
here.

832
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,296
Well, as you recall, collection

833
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,606
and table view, they're not

834
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:21,706
going to call out to your

835
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:22,966
delegate or data source about

836
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:23,586
placeholders.

837
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,816
That mean you're not going to

838
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:26,326
get a call for cell for row or

839
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:28,106
cell for item in index path for

840
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,856
placeholders, so this closure

841
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,936
serves as your replacement for

842
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,026
the configuration that you might

843
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:34,666
normally do in cell for row at

844
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,866
index path or cell for item in

845
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:36,536
index path.

846
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:38,936
Okay. There's one more thing.

847
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:40,166
Once you've inserted the

848
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,666
placeholder, it actually returns

849
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,086
something back to you, and

850
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,656
that's this placeholderContext.

851
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:46,646
What is this?

852
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:48,496
The placeholderContext is

853
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:49,646
returned for each placeholder

854
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:50,286
independently.

855
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,426
And this is how you're actually

856
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:53,786
going to commit the insertion of

857
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:55,236
the placeholder to exchange it

858
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:56,426
for the final cell once your

859
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:57,416
data finishes loading.

860
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,276
Or, if the data transfer failed.

861
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,596
Or maybe it was cancelled by the

862
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:02,006
user.

863
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:02,956
You can use the

864
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:04,426
placeholderContex to actually

865
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,416
delete the placeholder because

866
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,906
it'll no longer be needed.

867
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,466
So let's jump back to our code

868
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:10,346
and see how we use this

869
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:11,206
placeholderContext.

870
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:12,596
We're picking up right where we

871
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:13,206
left off.

872
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:14,326
We inserted our placeholder.

873
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:15,766
We got the placeholderContext

874
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,106
back.

875
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,506
Now we can actually go and load

876
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:18,806
the data.

877
00:24:19,596 --> 00:24:20,916
Again, this is asynchronous, so

878
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,556
we use this load object of class

879
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:23,506
method to do that.

880
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:25,266
When the closure completion

881
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:27,046
handler runs, that'll be called

882
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:27,926
on a background queue.

883
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,136
So we make sure to transition

884
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,596
back onto the main queue before

885
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:31,296
we update our UI.

886
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:34,036
And now we can check did we

887
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:35,566
actually get any data loaded?

888
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,436
If we did, we'll have an image

889
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,596
in this local variable here.

890
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,676
And now we call commitInsertion

891
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:42,036
on the placeholder context,

892
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,056
which again, we'll swap out that

893
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:45,506
placeholder cell and insert the

894
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:47,476
real cell at this particular

895
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:47,956
location.

896
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:50,036
Now you pass a closure to

897
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:50,816
commitInsertion.

898
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:52,296
Inside of that closure, it's

899
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:53,916
your responsibility to update

900
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,446
your data source to incorporate

901
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:57,376
the new data for the actual row

902
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:57,586
here.

903
00:24:58,156 --> 00:25:00,426
Or item in the collection view.

904
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,326
Now one other important thing.

905
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:03,996
Take a look at that index path

906
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:05,196
that's being passed inside that

907
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:06,906
closure, the insertionIndexPath.

908
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:08,796
You need to be very careful to

909
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,496
actually use that one and not

910
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:11,096
the original

911
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:12,946
destinationIndexPath that you

912
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:13,646
originally inserted the

913
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,376
placeholder at.

914
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:16,546
This is because between the time

915
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:17,086
when you inserted the

916
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:18,226
placeholder and when the data

917
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,736
finished loading, if other

918
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:20,936
updates happen in the collection

919
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,016
or table view, the placeholder

920
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:22,866
might have moved.

921
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:24,886
And so you use this index path,

922
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,496
which we provide to you, to tell

923
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,266
you the final location when the

924
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,366
placeholder insertion is

925
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:29,946
committed.

926
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,936
Okay, one other thing.

927
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,716
Of course, if our data transfer

928
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,276
didn't work for some reason, or

929
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:36,996
maybe it was cancelled, we can

930
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:38,126
just delete the placeholder

931
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:39,896
because we no longer need it.

932
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:41,976
Now one quick note about working

933
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:42,746
with placeholders.

934
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:43,976
It's very important that you

935
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,606
avoid calling reload data on the

936
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:46,786
collection or table view when

937
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:47,616
you have placeholders.

938
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:49,426
Instead, you should use

939
00:25:49,476 --> 00:25:50,796
performBatchUpdates.

940
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,386
This is so you can perform

941
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:53,626
incremental updates on the

942
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:54,676
collection or table view.

943
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:56,516
And the reason why you want to

944
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:57,896
avoid reload data is because

945
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,566
that just resets everything in

946
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:00,546
the collection or table view.

947
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:01,876
And, as a result, it's going to

948
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,166
strip out any existing

949
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,226
placeholders that you still

950
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:04,586
have.

951
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,866
If you use performBatchUpdates,

952
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,426
you'll be performing incremental

953
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:10,306
insertions and deletions, and we

954
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:11,496
can keep those placeholders

955
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:13,146
alive while you update your

956
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:14,326
collection view in real time.

957
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,016
You can use the new property

958
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:18,486
hasUncommittedUpdates on

959
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:19,776
collection and table view, if

960
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,686
you would like to check if it

961
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:22,236
has placeholders still around.

962
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:23,986
With that, I'd like to hand it

963
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:25,446
back to Mohammed to show you an

964
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:26,826
amazing demo of all this

965
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:28,326
placeholder goodness in action.

966
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:28,976
Mohammed.

967
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:31,796
[ Applause ]

968
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:32,776
Yeah. I can hold it.

969
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:35,646
>> Thanks Tyler.

970
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,636
Wow. Placeholders sound amazing,

971
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:38,016
don't they?

972
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:40,266
I can't wait to actually build

973
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,176
them in our app and build a

974
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:42,616
really awesome drop animation.

975
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:43,976
Let's get started.

976
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:49,256
So the first thing we'll want to

977
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:50,786
do is implement another optional

978
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:53,256
method on the drop delegate to

979
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:56,266
indicate to the collection view

980
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,086
that we'd like to animate our

981
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:00,666
dropped items to the drop point.

982
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:03,846
So let's add an implementation

983
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:06,056
for dropSessionDidUpdate

984
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,676
withDestinationIndexPath.

985
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:10,076
And we'll start returning a

986
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,596
collection view drop proposal

987
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,446
with a drop operation of copy

988
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:15,626
and an intent of

989
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:17,826
insertAtDestinationIndexPath.

990
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,746
Next, we'll head back to our

991
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,066
performDropWith coordinator

992
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,466
method and we're going to remove

993
00:27:24,466 --> 00:27:26,006
our existing coordinator code

994
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:26,946
because we're going to do

995
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:27,846
something a little different.

996
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:29,966
The first thing we'll want to do

997
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,586
is iterate the coordinator's

998
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:33,266
drop items or self, and we're

999
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,966
going to check if each drop

1000
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,196
item, drag item item provider

1001
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:40,196
can be used to load an object of

1002
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:40,956
class image.

1003
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:42,736
If it can, then we'll do a

1004
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:43,416
couple of things.

1005
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:47,106
First, we'll ask the coordinator

1006
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:50,186
to drop a placeholder at the

1007
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:51,506
destinationIndexPath.

1008
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:53,596
And we'll pass it a reuse

1009
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,306
identifier for a placeholder

1010
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,536
cell that we've registered with

1011
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:57,996
the collection view previously.

1012
00:27:58,756 --> 00:27:59,676
We're going to hang onto the

1013
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,026
placeholder context, because

1014
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,106
we're going to need it to update

1015
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,256
the collection view later on.

1016
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:08,046
Next, we'll actually trigger the

1017
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:09,776
data load by calling load object

1018
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,296
on the item provider and

1019
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,276
loadObjects is completion

1020
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:13,696
handler.

1021
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,946
We'll go ahead and handle the

1022
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:16,306
drop.

1023
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:18,646
Note that I'm dispatching back

1024
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,756
to the main queue here, since

1025
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:21,996
loadObjects is completion

1026
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:23,176
handler is called on a

1027
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:24,286
background queue, and we're

1028
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,826
going to be updating our UI.

1029
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,066
If the data transfer succeeded,

1030
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,746
we'll finalize the drop by

1031
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:33,086
calling commitInsertion on the

1032
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,236
placeholderContext.

1033
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:36,826
And we'll pass it a set of data

1034
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:39,456
source updates that use the

1035
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:42,776
insertionIndexPath to insert our

1036
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,006
new image in our [inaudible].

1037
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:49,776
Then if the data transfer failed

1038
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,336
for some reason, we'll make sure

1039
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:52,606
to clean things up by calling

1040
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,326
deletePlaceholder on a context.

1041
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,046
There's one more thing we should

1042
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:57,666
do here and that's to disable

1043
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,106
the default system progress UI

1044
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,536
for long-running data transfers,

1045
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,366
because we have our own inline

1046
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,066
one now.

1047
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,016
So we'll go ahead and do that by

1048
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,026
setting the drop session's

1049
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,456
progress indicator style to

1050
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:10,886
none.

1051
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:12,516
That's it.

1052
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:14,186
Let's see what it looks like on

1053
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:14,976
our device.

1054
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,646
So to get the full effect of

1055
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:21,986
what we've just done, I'm going

1056
00:29:22,106 --> 00:29:23,736
to -- instead of dragging out a

1057
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,236
photo, I'm going to switch over

1058
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,246
to a different app, which I've

1059
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,326
called Slow Photos, which

1060
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:31,486
intentionally slows down data

1061
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:32,246
transfers.

1062
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:35,326
I'm going to pick up a few of

1063
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:36,916
these images here and I'm going

1064
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:37,866
to head back to my collection

1065
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:38,196
view.

1066
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:39,836
Notice the first thing you'll

1067
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:41,376
notice here is that when I hover

1068
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,016
over the collection view, the

1069
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:44,886
cells start moving apart and we

1070
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:46,086
get this cool kind of

1071
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:48,736
springboard-like reordering

1072
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:49,726
look.

1073
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,426
This is because we started

1074
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:53,116
returning the

1075
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:55,186
insertAtDestinationIndexPath

1076
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:56,456
intent.

1077
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,696
If I let go of the dropped items

1078
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,606
-- oh, I love that animation

1079
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:02,906
[laughter].

1080
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:05,596
So note that the first thing we

1081
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,946
get are the placeholder cells

1082
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,526
with this inline progress UI.

1083
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,166
And a few seconds later, when

1084
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,076
the data transfer completes, we

1085
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,086
actually have the cells, the

1086
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:15,806
real cells with the real images

1087
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:15,976
loaded.

1088
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:21,776
[ Applause ]

1089
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:23,366
So now I'm going to hand it back

1090
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,686
to Tyler who's going to talk

1091
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:26,576
about some final touches that

1092
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,616
can really help you make the

1093
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:28,976
drag and drop experience in our

1094
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:29,976
app uniquely awesome.

1095
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:35,486
>> Okay. Thanks Mohammed.

1096
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,606
So let's wrap up by quickly

1097
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:38,726
jumping through some of the

1098
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:41,176
final touches that you can adopt

1099
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:42,606
using our wonderful APIs here.

1100
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,436
The first one that might be very

1101
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:45,836
interesting to you is supporting

1102
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:46,426
reordering.

1103
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:48,206
So now that we have Drag and

1104
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:49,856
Drop, it might be obvious that

1105
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:50,786
you might want to use that for

1106
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:51,316
reordering.

1107
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:52,836
Well you can of course do that

1108
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:54,086
and it's really easy.

1109
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:55,936
You start by implementing the

1110
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:56,886
dropDelegate method,

1111
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:57,946
dropSessionDidUpdate

1112
00:30:57,946 --> 00:30:59,416
withDestinationIndexPath.

1113
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:00,776
The reason why, of course,

1114
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:01,966
that's how you provide your drop

1115
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:03,116
proposal to the system.

1116
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:04,966
And, in particular, you need a

1117
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,386
very specific drop proposal if

1118
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:08,196
you like reorder, which is the

1119
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,636
drop proposal with an operation

1120
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:11,646
of move and an intent of

1121
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:13,426
insertAtDestinationIndexPath.

1122
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:15,246
That serves as a signal to the

1123
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:16,516
collection or table view that

1124
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:17,796
you're interested in supporting

1125
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:19,566
reordering, when the item that's

1126
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,616
being dragged comes from the

1127
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:21,626
same source view.

1128
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:23,906
Now here's where things get a

1129
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:24,936
little bit different for table

1130
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:25,676
view and collection view.

1131
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:26,496
We'll start with table view.

1132
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,256
With table view, table view has

1133
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,596
already supported reordering for

1134
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:31,896
a very long time and you're

1135
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:33,136
familiar with this very

1136
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,046
longstanding data source method.

1137
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:38,356
Table view moveRowAt IndexPath

1138
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,186
to IndexPath.

1139
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:40,956
You can continue to implement

1140
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:42,176
this, if you like, to support

1141
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,486
reordering, using Drag and Drop.

1142
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:44,926
Because table view is actually

1143
00:31:44,926 --> 00:31:46,336
going to call this instead of

1144
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:47,486
calling through perform drop

1145
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:48,796
with coordinator, if you've

1146
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:49,856
returned that magic drop

1147
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,376
proposal and a single row is

1148
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,296
actually being reordered.

1149
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:53,856
This makes it really easy,

1150
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,836
because you can use the same

1151
00:31:54,836 --> 00:31:56,836
code to ship on an iPhone.

1152
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:57,806
For example, maybe where you

1153
00:31:57,806 --> 00:31:59,546
don't have Drag and Drop using

1154
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:00,936
the existing style of

1155
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:01,506
reordering.

1156
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,556
And, if you are on an iPad, you

1157
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:04,556
can use the new style of

1158
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,186
reordering here.

1159
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,486
So that's table view.

1160
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:08,546
Pretty straightforward.

1161
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:10,246
Collection view is also equally

1162
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:10,946
easy, though.

1163
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:11,966
Collection view.

1164
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:12,866
You just need to make sure

1165
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:14,286
you're implementing both a drag

1166
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:15,216
and drop delegate.

1167
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:16,036
So both sides.

1168
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:18,666
And inside of perform drop with

1169
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:22,036
coordinator, you'll actually

1170
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:24,226
look at the drop items that we

1171
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:25,206
passed to you in that

1172
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:25,836
coordinator.

1173
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:27,426
We actually are providing a

1174
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:28,986
sourceIndexPath for each of

1175
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:30,096
those items, which will be

1176
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:32,476
non-nil, if the item represents

1177
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:34,246
a particular item in the

1178
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,256
collection view that it came

1179
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:35,556
from.

1180
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:37,926
So you can delete the item at

1181
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,886
that sourceIndexPath and insert

1182
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:41,286
a new item at the

1183
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:42,676
destinationIndexPath.

1184
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:44,366
And that's going to affect the

1185
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:45,166
actual reorder.

1186
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:46,876
So you'll have that cell move

1187
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:48,216
seamlessly from the start to the

1188
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:48,786
destination.

1189
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:51,456
Now collection view has some

1190
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,656
extra functionality for

1191
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:54,356
reordering, though, and that's

1192
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,056
this new concept of reordering

1193
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:56,626
cadence.

1194
00:32:58,096 --> 00:32:59,136
As you know, collection views

1195
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,726
often have these two-dimensional

1196
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:01,836
grid-like layouts.

1197
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:02,936
For example, the flow layout you

1198
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:03,606
see behind me.

1199
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,876
And when you're reordering,

1200
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:08,336
sometimes you can get the kind

1201
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:09,666
of behavior where the items are

1202
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,096
reflowing out as you're moving

1203
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:11,616
your finger.

1204
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:12,696
And that's great when you're

1205
00:33:12,696 --> 00:33:13,666
actually trying to reorder.

1206
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:15,436
But you don't always want that

1207
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:15,856
behavior.

1208
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:16,826
Maybe if you're trying to just

1209
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:18,096
drag to a different location

1210
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,206
outside of the collection view

1211
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:20,336
and it happens to support

1212
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:20,776
reordering.

1213
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,496
So the reordering cadence has

1214
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:23,586
three different values to help

1215
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,066
you tune how responsive the

1216
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,296
collection view is going to be

1217
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:27,986
when it shuffles and reflows its

1218
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:28,386
layout.

1219
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:30,176
So the default, of course, is

1220
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,516
immediate, which you've seen in

1221
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:32,376
the demos so far.

1222
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:33,506
Where once you start moving

1223
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:34,856
around, it immediately is going

1224
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:35,996
to reflow the collection view

1225
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:37,556
layout as you're -- you know,

1226
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,846
almost in real time reordering.

1227
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:40,606
If you'd like to add a little

1228
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:42,446
bit more deliberance here, you

1229
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:44,826
can switch to the fast mode.

1230
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:47,516
Where, if you move very quickly,

1231
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:48,886
it won't actually immediately

1232
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,606
reshuffle all the layout around.

1233
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:51,796
And so you can see you have to

1234
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,326
pause just a little bit longer.

1235
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:55,996
And then for slow, it

1236
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,246
exaggerates that even further.

1237
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,276
So the user really has to be

1238
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,786
deliberate about wanting to stop

1239
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:00,776
and reorder to a specific

1240
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:01,286
location.

1241
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:02,456
This is how you're going to get

1242
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:03,816
behavior very consistent with

1243
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:05,576
the behavior you see on the iOS

1244
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,886
Home screen when reordering app

1245
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:07,786
icons, for example.

1246
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:09,786
So that's reordering.

1247
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,235
Let's talk about spring loading.

1248
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:13,206
Spring loading, as you probably

1249
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,795
know by now, is a way to

1250
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,266
actually navigate and activate

1251
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,536
controls throughout the system

1252
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:18,366
while you're in the middle of a

1253
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,056
drag session.

1254
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,166
You just hover over the

1255
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:20,755
controls.

1256
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,216
It starts highlighting and then

1257
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:23,016
it's going to activate.

1258
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:24,735
So, in collection and table

1259
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:26,346
view, it's dropped at easy to

1260
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:27,815
adopt spring loading and that's

1261
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,866
because both of them conform to

1262
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,025
the protocol UISpringLoaded

1263
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:32,985
InteractionSupporting.

1264
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,646
Basically that just means they

1265
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:35,616
each have a property

1266
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,176
isSpringLoaded, which you set to

1267
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,946
true, and spring loading works.

1268
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:41,235
When users spring load on a

1269
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:42,356
particular cell, we're going to

1270
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:43,346
call -- we're going to select

1271
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,505
that item or row in the

1272
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:45,366
collection or table view.

1273
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,266
And you can customize spring

1274
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:48,556
loading using a new delegate

1275
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,516
method shouldSpringLoadItemAt

1276
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:51,735
IndexPath with context.

1277
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,176
This is how you can opt out

1278
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,565
specific rows of spring loading.

1279
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:56,976
Or you can even customize spring

1280
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:58,716
loading effects a bit using that

1281
00:34:58,716 --> 00:34:59,126
context.

1282
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:00,476
For example, you can change the

1283
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:01,846
view that actually flashes

1284
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:02,536
during the spring load

1285
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:03,096
interaction.

1286
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,786
So next, let's talk a little bit

1287
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,416
about customizing appearance.

1288
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:10,776
We have some new ways that you

1289
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,096
can customize the appearance of

1290
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:13,776
cells that are participating in

1291
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:14,636
drag sessions.

1292
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,096
So cells start -- they have a

1293
00:35:17,096 --> 00:35:18,376
new notion of a drag state, and

1294
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,686
they all start in the none

1295
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:21,186
state, and that's before

1296
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:21,946
anything's happened.

1297
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:23,266
But when the user actually puts

1298
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,306
their finger on the glass and

1299
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:25,296
starts lifting one of those

1300
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:26,746
cells, we're going to transition

1301
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:28,086
the cell to the lifting state.

1302
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:29,696
And, as you can see here, in

1303
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:31,036
this example, we have a little

1304
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:32,226
banner showing on each of the

1305
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:32,666
cells.

1306
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:33,846
And we'd rather not actually

1307
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,176
show that banner when the user's

1308
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,776
dragging the cell all around

1309
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:37,506
across the system.

1310
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,606
So we can use this transition of

1311
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,136
the state to the lifting state

1312
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:43,106
to actually hide that banner.

1313
00:35:44,386 --> 00:35:45,676
When the user actually moves

1314
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,986
their finger to actually begin

1315
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:48,696
the drag session, once the cell

1316
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:50,236
finishes the lift, we'll

1317
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:52,016
transition the cell that remains

1318
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,096
behind in the collection or

1319
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:54,396
table view to the dragging

1320
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:54,786
state.

1321
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,606
And by default, this is going to

1322
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:58,396
result in a faded appearance,

1323
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:00,066
where we'll reduce the alpha of

1324
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:00,636
that cell.

1325
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,566
Now you can respond to these

1326
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:05,156
state transitions by overriding

1327
00:36:05,156 --> 00:36:06,916
the method on your cell class,

1328
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:09,476
subclass, dragStateDidChange.

1329
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:10,856
Just use the new state that's

1330
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:11,566
being passed in.

1331
00:36:11,566 --> 00:36:13,326
You can optionally call super to

1332
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:14,596
get the default appearance and

1333
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:14,956
behavior.

1334
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:16,326
Or you can just choose to

1335
00:36:16,326 --> 00:36:17,756
override it and provide your own

1336
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:18,766
behavior and implementation.

1337
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,636
We will even make sure to call

1338
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,096
these state transitions inside

1339
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,926
and alongside animation closure

1340
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:25,826
with the actual lift animations,

1341
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:26,286
for example.

1342
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:28,056
So if you make changes here,

1343
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:28,896
they're going to be animated

1344
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:30,216
running forwards and backwards

1345
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:30,936
with those lifts.

1346
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,116
So that's how we customize the

1347
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:35,386
actual cell that is in the

1348
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:36,456
collection or table view, but

1349
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:37,656
what about the actual drag

1350
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,126
preview that you drag around?

1351
00:36:39,526 --> 00:36:41,166
As you see here, in this

1352
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,006
example, we have a cell that is

1353
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:45,076
basically a square shape.

1354
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,416
But, if the content that's

1355
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:48,726
visible is a wider aspect ratio,

1356
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:50,736
it's showing a nice image and so

1357
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:51,946
we result in, you know, these

1358
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,316
not very pretty white bars at

1359
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,036
the top and bottom.

1360
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:56,246
Probably don't really want this

1361
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,106
appearance while the user's

1362
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:58,396
dragging this, you know, photo

1363
00:36:58,396 --> 00:36:58,996
around the system.

1364
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:00,216
So how can we fix that?

1365
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,356
Well, by default, it's happening

1366
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:04,906
because we use the entire cell

1367
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:05,866
as the drag preview.

1368
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:07,436
But, of course, you can change

1369
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:07,656
that.

1370
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,636
And so you can provide drag

1371
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:10,816
preview parameters by

1372
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:12,156
implementing an optional method

1373
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:13,086
on the dragDelegate,

1374
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:14,886
dragPreviewParametersForItemAt

1375
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:15,476
IndexPath.

1376
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:16,916
And, if you provide these,

1377
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:18,116
there's, for example, an

1378
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:19,456
opportunity for you to provide a

1379
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:21,136
bezier path, which will clip to

1380
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:22,356
a specific region within the

1381
00:37:22,356 --> 00:37:22,726
cell.

1382
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:24,476
So if we look back at our

1383
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,246
example, if we return a bezier

1384
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,796
path that clips to the actual

1385
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:29,266
rect where there's a visible

1386
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:30,966
photo, we can just lift just

1387
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,466
that photo off the screen even

1388
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,796
though the cell is still a

1389
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:34,766
square in this example.

1391
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:39,376
Okay. Wow.

1392
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:40,716
We've covered a lot today.

1393
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:42,246
So what are the next steps for

1394
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:42,386
you?

1395
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,486
Well, first of all, we hope when

1396
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:46,756
you leave here you go and add

1397
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:47,666
Drag and Drop to all the

1398
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,776
collection and table views in

1399
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:49,686
your applications.

1400
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,876
You saw how easy it is just to

1401
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:52,306
get the basics up and running

1402
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:53,176
very quickly.

1403
00:37:53,736 --> 00:37:54,896
And users are going to expect

1404
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,126
that your apps support Drag and

1405
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,276
Drop in iOS 11.

1406
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,196
Now you should definitely

1407
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:00,326
consider providing a drop

1408
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:02,116
proposal and setting up those

1409
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,506
great animations, because we

1410
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:04,966
made it really easy to do so.

1411
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:06,876
And it will provide the best

1412
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,286
look and feel for your users.

1413
00:38:08,676 --> 00:38:10,946
And, of course, don't forget

1414
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:11,746
about placeholders.

1415
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:13,076
When your data is loading

1416
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,746
asynchronously, use placeholders

1417
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,636
to very easily manage that

1418
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:18,756
asynchronous data load and keep

1419
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,496
the UI completely responsive and

1420
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:21,776
interactive during any

1421
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:22,816
long-running transfers.

1422
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:24,966
And finally, don't forget to

1423
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:25,836
polish the details.

1424
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:27,696
We can't wait to see what you

1425
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:29,136
will do with all of these really

1426
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:31,306
awesome APIs, and we're going to

1427
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:32,866
