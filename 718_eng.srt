1
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:18,116
>> Welcome.

2
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,796
This year, we are delighted to

3
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,896
introduce a new framework in iOS

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:25,756
11 called Core NFC, that would

5
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,946
allow your apps to integrate NFC

6
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,466
on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

7
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:34,126
Using Core NFC, apps can

8
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,486
interact with their physical

9
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,076
environment and the real-world

10
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:38,046
objects within it.

11
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,056
You may already know that Apple

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,736
Pay uses NFC for complex

13
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,376
payment.

14
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,966
Now, with the introduction of

15
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,656
Core NFC, you will be able to

16
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:52,716
use NFC in your applications to

17
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,576
create new and innovative user

18
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:58,676
experiences with the iPhone.

19
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:00,686
In this session, we will give

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,436
you a brief overview of new

21
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,476
field communications, what is

22
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,576
supported in the Core NFC

23
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,916
framework, the requirements and

24
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,236
details for using it, and some

25
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:12,096
example code.

26
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,056
To start off, let's talk a

27
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,616
little bit about Near Field

28
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:18,346
Communication.

29
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,736
Near Field Communication, known

30
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:25,686
simply as NFC, is a wireless

31
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,126
technology that allows the

32
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,926
exchange of information between

33
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:30,576
devices that are within close

34
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:31,276
proximity.

35
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,986
Limited to a range of just a few

36
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:34,796
centimeters.

37
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:38,366
NFC is actually a collection of

38
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,936
a number of different standards

39
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:40,846
and protocols.

40
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,696
All of these standards coexist

41
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,066
and are used in different

42
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:45,896
applications.

43
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,316
You may have seen or had

44
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,156
experience with NFC text.

45
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,926
The small little stickers or

46
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:53,706
cards which can be read

47
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,066
wirelessly by an NFC reader.

48
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,396
NFC text comes in a wide variety

49
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:01,326
of shapes, sizes, and

50
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,056
capacities.

51
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,496
They are classified into five

52
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,286
categories, known as Type 1

53
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:07,306
through Type 5.

54
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:09,636
Each one corresponding to a

55
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:10,466
different standard.

56
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,896
For example, Type 3 texts are

57
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:14,956
based on FEDECA [assumed

58
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,256
spelling] and Type 4 is based on

59
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,486
ISO-14443.

60
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:23,856
The NFC Forum has defined the

61
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:26,576
NFC Data Exchange Format, or

62
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,726
NDEF for short, as a common

63
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:30,526
messaging format for exchanging

64
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,646
data in a standardized way among

65
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,356
the different text types.

66
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,036
Now that we have covered some

67
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,586
NFC basics, let's take a look at

68
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,086
what you can do with Core NFC.

69
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,016
For the initial launch of Core

70
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,626
NFC, we have focused on NFC Tag

71
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,146
Reading, which can be used to

72
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,886
enhance the user experience in a

73
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,516
wide variety of ways.

74
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:57,516
Potential applications include

75
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,606
connecting user to location or

76
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:03,586
context-specific content,

77
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,026
connecting physical hardware

78
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:09,086
with your application, and even

79
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,666
for in-store product information

80
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,886
or inventory tracking.

81
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,306
In addition, NFC Tags can be

82
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,206
used in place of QR codes.

83
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:21,876
Core NFC will allow your

84
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,686
application to read any NDEF

85
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,626
formatted tag.

86
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,066
This greatly simplifies the

87
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,586
process of reading tags within

88
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,056
your application or for having

89
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,196
to deal with the different

90
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:31,936
standards.

91
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,366
Tag reading is supported on

92
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,416
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

93
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,806
At this time, Core NFC does not

94
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,576
support writing or formatting

95
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:42,406
operations.

96
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,886
There are two requirements for

97
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,386
using Core NFC in your

98
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:49,616
application.

99
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,816
First, Core NFC is an

100
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,966
entitlement-protective

101
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:55,486
framework.

102
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,216
You will need to turn on the

103
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,116
Near Field Communication Tag

104
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,406
Reading Capability from Xcode to

105
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,476
get this entitlement.

106
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,856
However, this capability would

107
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,426
not be in Xcode for the first

108
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,216
[inaudible] released at WWDC.

109
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,966
In the meantime, you can

110
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,326
manually request this

111
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,756
entitlement by visiting the

112
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,016
Certificates, Identifiers and

113
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,185
Profiles page on the Apple

114
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,196
Developer website.

115
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,796
The second requirement for Core

116
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:28,056
NFC is a Scan Usage Description.

117
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,976
This string is required in your

118
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,016
application's info P-list file,

119
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,786
and it will be displayed to the

120
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,126
user when your application

121
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:38,426
starts NFC scanning.

122
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,716
For more information, you can

123
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,986
watch the WWDC session, Privacy

124
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:44,956
and Your Apps.

125
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:49,656
Now that you have configured

126
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,666
your project correctly, let's

127
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,066
review some additional details

128
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,846
about tag reading with the Core

129
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:55,706
NFC framework.

130
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,856
First, tag reading is an

131
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,916
on-demand process, meaning that

132
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,656
your application has to initiate

133
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:06,496
a tag reading activity using a

134
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:06,986
session.

135
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,086
Second, your application has to

136
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:12,906
be visible and foregrounded in

137
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,436
order to start a tag reading

138
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:14,996
activity.

139
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,096
A tag reading session will be

140
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,596
ended if your application is

141
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,146
backgrounded or ceases to be

142
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:20,566
visible.

143
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,596
Next, each tag reading activity

144
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,326
is limited to 60 seconds at a

145
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:26,746
time.

146
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,956
If a session has timed out or

147
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,586
invalidated, your application

148
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,936
must create a new session to

149
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,646
initiate another tag reading

150
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:34,206
activity.

151
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:38,246
You can configure a session to

152
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,096
read either a single tag or

153
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,126
multiple tags.

154
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,596
In a single tag reading mode,

155
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,516
the session will be ended

156
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,316
automatically after a tag is

157
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:47,676
read.

158
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,296
On the other hand, a multi-tag

159
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,636
reading session will remain

160
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,096
active until canceled by the

161
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,966
user, or the 60-second timeout

162
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:55,606
is reached.

163
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,156
Finally, as mentioned

164
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,996
previously, the NFC Usage String

165
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:06,136
defined in your info P-list will

166
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,706
be displayed to the user while

167
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,166
the tag reading activity is in

168
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:09,746
progress.

169
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:13,926
We have provided a sample

170
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,126
application along with this

171
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,436
presentation to demonstrate the

172
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:19,126
use of Core NFC.

173
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,396
Consider the case where you want

174
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,566
to take a physical kind of

175
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,266
inventory.

176
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,666
Here, we are showing you the key

177
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,446
user interaction sequence of the

178
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:27,466
sample application.

179
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,936
The sample application consists

180
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,806
of a main table view, and a Scan

181
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:32,266
button.

182
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,686
Every time an inventory item is

183
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,486
scanned, it is displayed as a

184
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,086
role entry in this main table

185
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:38,416
view.

186
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,906
Just click on the Scan button to

187
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:44,876
start a tag scanning.

188
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,816
This UI will be presented to the

189
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,836
user hopefully on top of your

190
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,836
application once tag scanning

191
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:51,476
has begun.

192
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:54,406
During tag scanning, the user's

193
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,076
description string is displayed

194
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:56,986
within the UI.

195
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,496
At any time, the user can hit

196
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,106
the Cancel button to stop a tag

197
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,146
scanning, which will invalidate

198
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:03,886
the reader session.

199
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:09,106
The UI will get updated once an

200
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,116
NFC tag has been successfully

201
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:11,476
read.

202
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,196
Here, we have configured our

203
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,916
reader session to be single tag

204
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,516
read mode.

205
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,026
Finally, the overlaid UI will be

206
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,526
dismissed, and the application

207
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,136
will be foregrounded once the

208
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:26,886
tag reading session has ended.

209
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:30,966
All right.

210
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,136
Let's walk through the code

211
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,146
together from the sample

212
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,536
application we have just shown.

213
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:38,336
At a high level, you would need

214
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,766
to perform these three easy

215
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,916
steps to enable tag reading in

216
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,676
your application.

217
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:47,326
First, adopt the NFC NDEF Reader

218
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:48,836
Session Delegate Protocol.

219
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,596
Next, create an instance of the

220
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,626
NFC NDEF Reader Session Class,

221
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,546
and provide it with your

222
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:57,066
delegate.

223
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,086
Finally, start a reader session

224
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,506
using the Begin method, and

225
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,116
handle the delegate callbacks.

226
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:09,156
Here is a cool snippet from the

227
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,676
sample application, illustrating

228
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:11,836
the three-step approach.

229
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,846
To start off, we import the Core

230
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,986
NFC framework into the code.

231
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,386
Here we adopt the delegate

232
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,706
protocol in Table View

233
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,016
Controller, which will handle

234
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:26,716
the two required callbacks.

235
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,996
They invalidate with error and

236
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,236
detect NDEF.

237
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:38,385
The invalidate with error

238
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,986
callback will notify your

239
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,486
application when a tag reading

240
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,616
activity has stopped.

241
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,746
This can happen for a variety of

242
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:46,326
reasons.

243
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,556
For example, a tag has been

244
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,246
successfully read in a single

245
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,116
tag read session.

246
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:53,536
The user has chosen to stop the

247
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:54,696
tag scanning activity.

248
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,716
The 3-second timeout has expired

249
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,056
or the application is no longer

250
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:00,756
in the foreground.

251
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,766
The specific session object

252
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,186
provided in the first parameter

253
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,896
will be invalidated after the

254
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:07,926
function exits.

255
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,276
A new reader session instance is

256
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,146
required for additional tag

257
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:12,446
reading.

258
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:17,166
The detect NDEFs will be invoked

259
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,136
every time an NDEF has been read

260
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,226
from an NFC tag.

261
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,816
Your application can then grab

262
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:23,946
the payload from the NDEF

263
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,706
message, decode it, and handle

264
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:27,996
the message as appropriate.

265
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,846
Finally, we have an extra method

266
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:35,236
that links to the Scan button

267
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:36,736
for starting a single tag read

268
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:37,226
session.

269
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,196
All you need to do is create an

270
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,136
instance of NFC NDEF Reader

271
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,786
Session with your data gate,

272
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,636
then invoke to begin method to

273
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:46,776
start tag scanning.

274
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,926
If you wish to create a

275
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,326
multi-tag reading session, set

276
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:53,126
the invalidate at the first read

277
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,316
parameter to False.

278
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,606
If you need to stop an ongoing

279
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:58,296
session programmatically, you

280
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,886
can call the invalidate method.

281
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,116
This will trigger your

282
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,096
invalidate with error callback,

283
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,476
letting you know that the

284
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:06,396
session has ended.

285
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,386
In summary, it is very simple to

286
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,276
enable NFC tag reading with Core

287
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,766
NFC by following these steps.

288
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,116
Enable the NFC tag reading

289
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:22,846
capability.

290
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:26,676
Make sure your Scan Usage

291
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,336
Description String is set in

292
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,426
your info P-list.

293
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,906
Integrate the Core NFC framework

294
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:34,566
in your code.

295
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,776
And start reading tags.
