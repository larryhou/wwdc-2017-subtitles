My name is Skylar Peterson, I am

a member of Apple's iOS

12
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:46,946
today to talk to you about

13
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:48,486
what's new in accessibility this

15
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:52,246
So, for those of you that don't

16
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:53,936
know exactly what I mean when I

17
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:56,046
say accessibility well first of

18
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:57,456
all, I'm happy that you're here

19
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,366
and second, when we think about

20
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:03,266
Accessibility it's really making

21
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:06,016
technology usable by everyone

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,536
regardless of whatever their

23
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:08,996
unique needs might be.

24
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:11,776
At Apple, we approach this

25
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:14,106
problem by examining four major

26
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,116
classes of user ability,

27
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:19,816
cognitive, motor, vision and

28
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:19,966
hearing.

29
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,206
Cognitive encompasses conditions

30
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:30,106
like dyslexia or autism.

31
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,166
Motor examines the way in which

32
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,806
a user physically interacts with

33
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:37,556
the system, whether they need

34
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,836
special accommodations for a

35
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,506
condition like Parkinson's or

36
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:41,346
cerebral palsy.

37
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,946
Vision which encompasses a range

38
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,966
of visionability from those with

39
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,016
low vision conditions to those

40
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,006
who are completely blind.

41
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,016
And finally hearing which like

42
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:59,006
vision encompasses a spectrum of

43
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:01,146
hearing ability from those who

44
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:02,946
are hard of hearing to those

45
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:06,326
that are completely deaf.

46
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,175
Worldwide there are over a

47
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,756
billion people who have some

48
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,236
form of disability that fit into

49
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,416
one of those categories.

50
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,996
Put another way, one in seven,

51
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:21,626
one in seven people have a form

52
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,886
of disability which means that

53
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:25,786

54
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,806

disability.

56
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:30,736
But at the end of the day

57
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,436
accessibility isn't about

58
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,536
numbers it's about people.

59
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,476

transformative power to enable.

possibilities of what people can

00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:52,986

00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,496

146
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,916
to talking about what you as a

147
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,086

148

150
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,136

00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,136
take a look at some of the

157
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:34,116
basics of our accessibility API

158

162
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,576
From there we're going to go

163
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:45,066
beyond the basics to look at

164
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,736
some of our more advanced APIs

165
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,216
to help you solve some common

00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:49,466
problems that you might find

167
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:51,016
while making your own apps

169
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:55,416
And finally, I'd like to spend a

170
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,306
little bit of time talking about

some accessibility

172
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,256
considerations that you should

173
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,526
make when implementing the

00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:45,166
as on macOS if you focus on an

196
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,756
image we're going to do some

197
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,306
basic text detection to try and

198
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,776
figure out if there's text

199
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,416
within that image and if it

200
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,636
makes sense to speak it then

201
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,986
we're going to speak to the user

202
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,836
and it sounds a little something

203
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,016
like this.

204
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:58,956
>> Possible text, I can't

205
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,276
believe I took this with my

206
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:00,886
iPhone.

207
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:04,396
>> Now along that same vein,

208
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:06,526
we're introducing improved photo

209
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:08,576
descriptions for VoiceOver users

210
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,816
systemwide.

211
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,346
So, when a VoiceOver user

212
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,686
focuses on an image we're going

213
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,696
to run some basic analysis to

214
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,756
try and figure out what's

215
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:19,926
contained within that image and

216
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,966
speak details about it so that

217
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:23,706
VoiceOver users get a richer

218
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:24,446
description.

219
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:26,736
We look for things like the

220
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,436
number of faces within an image,

221
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:29,906
what expressions are they

222
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:32,066
making, what's the overall scene

223
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,576
of that image, and what's its

224
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:34,956
blurriness or brightness level.

225
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,996
So, a description for an image

226
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:38,635
like this one might sound like

227
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:38,966
this.

228
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,376
>> One face, one smiling,

229
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,736
nightclub, blurry, bright.

230
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,206
>> Now if you're a developer

231
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:48,406
who's already gone through and

232
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:49,766
done your due diligence of

233
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,316
labeling all your images don't

234
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:52,646
worry we're not just going to

235
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,436
hijack that description from

236
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:54,676
you.

237
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,416
Instead, if a user wants to hear

238
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,486
the description that we

239
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,146
ourselves have generated that

240
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,456
all they need to do is a single

241
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,886
three-finger tap on the image

242
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:03,976
and they'll hear our

243
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,486
description.

244
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:11,186
Next, we have large texts.

245
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,976
So, this year our team did an

246
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,566
audit of the large text

247
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:18,226
experience systemwide with a

248
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,956
real focus on the experience of

249
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,926
those users who use our largest

250
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,616
accessibility text sizes.

251
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,756
And we worked with teams across

252
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:28,596
Apple to really, really improve

253
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,176
this experience, which also

254
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,796
includes some new APIs.

255
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,346
Now there's a lot that I could

256
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,506
say about this feature.

257
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,776
In fact, there's so much that I

258
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,126
could say about this feature

259
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,836
there's a whole other session

260
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,936
dedicated just to dynamic type

261
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,086
it's called Building Apps with

262
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:45,736
Dynamic Type.

263
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:47,416
It's going to be in the

264
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,346
executive ballroom Friday at

265
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:51,736
1:50 and I highly, highly

266
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:54,036
recommend that you attend to

267
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,586
figure out how to best adapt

268
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,896
your own apps for dynamic type

269
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:58,906
in iOS 11.

270
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:01,066
Now there are two other sessions

271
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,286
up here that I'd like to point

272
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,856
out that also contain relevant

273
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,236
information about dynamic type.

274
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,496
The first Design for Everyone is

275
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:11,746
a session that focuses on the

276
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,936
design of accessibility, but

277
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,956
will also contain a portion that

278
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:18,326
will cover dynamic type,

279
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,286
including some of the rationale

280
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:22,386
behind decisions that we made

281
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,126
when adapting the layouts for

282
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,846
large text and design

283
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,236
considerations that you yourself

284
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:28,796
should make when designing your

285
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:29,426
own apps.

286
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,736
And second, Auto Layout

287
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:33,516
Techniques in Interface Builder

288
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:36,336
will have a portion dedicated to

289
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,936
adapting your layouts that are

290
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,116
built with interface builder for

291
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:40,776
dynamic type.

292
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,776
So, I hope to see you all at

293
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,206
these sessions.

294
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,826
Moving on, we have the

295
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,466
Accessibility keyboard.

296
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:52,826
This is a feature built for

297
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,466
macOS for users who have enough

298
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,186
dexterity to use a trackpad, but

299
00:10:58,186 --> 00:11:00,206
can't necessarily use a physical

300
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:00,746
keyboard.

301
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:03,816
It's an onscreen keyboard that

302
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,676
has things like system controls

303
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,786
and a predictive text bar and is

304
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,206
fully customizable, which means

305
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:13,756
that if I have certain actions

306
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,946
that I do on a daily basis that

307
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:18,446
I want to create a custom panel

308
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:20,206
for so I just have to click it

309
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:21,636
once and it'll initiate that

310
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:23,236
action then I can create those

311
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:23,736
panels.

312
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,466
So, for instance if I email my

313
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,426
manager every day I may create a

314
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:30,426
custom panel that opens mail,

315
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:33,196
composes an email, and adds her

316
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:37,526
address in there.

317
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:41,326
Next, we have Type to Siri, so

318
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,926
like the title suggests this

319
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,496
feature allows you to interact

320
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,796
with Siri via text input like

321
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,456
you would via speech.

322
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:50,396
And we're really excited about

323
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:51,686
this because it's going to open

324
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:54,426
up Siri to a class of users who

325
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:55,856
are unable to use it before,

326
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,086
those who are nonverbal.

327
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:03,206
Finally, we have Smart Invert

328
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:03,826
Colors.

329
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,526
So, previously on iOS if you

330
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,816
enabled the invert colors

331
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,756
feature it would invert all the

332
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:12,176
content of your device

333
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:13,576
regardless of what kind of

334
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:14,746
content it is.

335
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,346
But this year we're introducing

336
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:18,696
Smart Invert Colors, which looks

337
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,216
at specific kinds of content

338
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,156
like graphics or images and

339
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,506
doesn't invert them so that you

340
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,966
can see the content as it was

341
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:26,886
actually meant to be.

342
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:28,886
Now I'd actually like to do a

343
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:29,896
demo of that feature for you

344
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:29,976
now.

345
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:42,916
So, I have my device here and

346
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,506
I'm going to enable Smart Invert

347
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,016
Colors.

348
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:48,776
Now as you can see, the

349
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:51,596
wallpaper wasn't inverted nor

350
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,156
were all of the app icons.

351
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,696
And if I go into my Photos app,

352
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:58,876
you'll see that I still have the

353
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:02,136
dark UI that is important for

354
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:04,586
users who use invert colors that

355
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,486
have certain low-vision

356
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,946
conditions where a white UI

357
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,496
makes the display too difficult

358
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,816
to look at for prolonged periods

359
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:11,186
of time.

360
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,836
So, I can still see my photos as

361
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,816
they originally were.

362
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:20,416
Now if I go to an app like Clock

363
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:22,226
which already had a dark UI

364
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,936
you'll also notice that we

365
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,296
haven't inverted that UI to keep

366
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:30,096
the dark look around that is so

367
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,306
important to our invert colors

368
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:31,806
users.

369
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:34,186
Now that's just a very basic

370
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:36,426
overview of that feature and I

371
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:37,476
highly recommend that you check

372
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,036
it out yourself and see how it

373
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,596
plays around with your own apps.

374
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:46,906
But now I'd like to pivot into

375
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:49,096
talking about the experience of

376
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,086
you as a developer and how you

377
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,626
make sure that all of your work

378
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,366
works with all the things that I

379
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,436
just covered, as well as all of

380
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,226
our old features.

381
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,826
And that really begins by

382
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:01,396
auditing your app for

383
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,126
accessibility.

384
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:06,076
So, when we're starting an audit

385
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:07,626
the first thing you're going to

386
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:09,466
want to do is enable an

387
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,816
accessible technology like

388
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,036
Voiceover or Switch Control and

389
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,996
see what the experience is like

390
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,366
for a Voiceover user.

391
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,326
So, to do that we're going to

392
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:24,086
tap on General Accessibility and

393
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:25,636
go down to this accessibility

394
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,816
shortcut page and add VoiceOver

395
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:28,546
to our shortcut.

396
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,496
What this does is that now

397
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,086
whenever I triple click the Home

398
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,176
button VoiceOver will turn on

399
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:37,916
and if I have VoiceOver on

400
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,206
already it will turn VoiceOver

401
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:41,476
off so I can quickly cycle

402
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:42,786
between the two as I'm going

403
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,326
through my app.

404
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:46,856
And now that we have VoiceOver

405
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:46,976
on.

406
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:52,206
We're going to Home out of

407
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,306
settings and go to the app that

408
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,956
we want to audit and just start

409
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:58,746
playing around to see what the

410
00:14:58,746 --> 00:14:59,996
experience is like for a

411
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,006
VoiceOver user.

412
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,356
Are all the things that I would

413
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,356
expect to be visible visible?

414
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,076
Are the things that I would not

415
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:08,826
want to be visible to a

416
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,016
VoiceOver user not visible to

417
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:10,336
them?

418
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,726
Does every interaction with the

419
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,006
interface have some sort of

420
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:15,416
corollary that a VoiceOver user

421
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,306
can take advantage of?

422
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,216
And does the UI itself make

423
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,686
sense, does the flow make sense?

424
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:26,236
As well are elements properly

425
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:26,746
labeled?

426
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:28,856
For instance, I would expect

427
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:30,866
this button that's an upload

428
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:33,476
button to be labeled upload tell

429
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,046
me it has three votes currently

430
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:35,786
and that it's a button.

431
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:41,746
Now we have a tool called the

432
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,656
Accessibility Inspector that can

433
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:45,456
also be used for auditing your

434
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:46,416
apps.

435
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:50,176
You can get to it by going to

436
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,366
Xcode, open Developer Tool and

437
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:54,496
opening the Accessibility

438
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,066
Inspector.

439
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,826
And what this tool allows you to

440
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:59,226
do is look at specific elements

441
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,316
of your screen and get their

442
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,606
accessibility information, as

443
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,496
well as run a full audit of the

444
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,166
accessibility in your app.

445
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,726
Now I'm not going to cover using

446
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,196
this tool today, but there was a

447
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:15,946
session at last year's WWDC that

448
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:18,056
covered extensively how you take

449
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:19,986
advantage of this app and work

450
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,306
it into your own workflow.

451
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:22,696
So, if you're interested in that

452
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:24,276
I recommend that you check it

453
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:24,926
out at this link.

454
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,266
Instead, what I like to do now

455
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,546
for you is demo auditing a

456
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,446
sample app that I've been

457
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:31,966
working on.

458
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:41,896
So, I'm going to come to my

459
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,986
device here and you can see I

460
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,326
have this app down in the corner

461
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,226
called Pre-Poster.

462
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:50,076
Now this is an app I've been

463
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,826
working on that allows me to

464
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:54,196
post posts to a social network

465
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,206
to a close group of friends

466
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:58,276
before I post it to the wider

467
00:16:58,276 --> 00:16:59,516
social network to make sure I

468
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,276
have all my friends' approval of

469
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:02,226
those things I'm posting.

470
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,826
Now I have things like up vote

471
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,126
buttons and down vote buttons so

472
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,165
that friends can tell me whether

473
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:12,096
it's good or not, comments, I

474
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,996
have even star ratings so that I

475
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,846
can rate how good a post is, and

476
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,766
I have settings that allow me to

477
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,636
set which social networks I want

478
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,695
to automatically post to when

479
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:24,736
the timer runs down.

480
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:28,996
So, let's turn on VoiceOver and

481
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:30,626
just see what we find.

482
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,736
I'm going to triple click the

483
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,206
Home button and as you can see,

484
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:34,996
I have my accessibility

485
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,456
shortcuts to include the

486
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,226
VoiceOver and Smart Invert and

487
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:39,576
I'm going to select VoiceOver.

488
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:44,136
>> VoiceOver on Pre-Poster Tom

489
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,666
McNeil, [inaudible] button,

490
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:52,006
three button, button, two open

491
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:52,456
posts.

492
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,496
>> So, I'm swiping my finger

493
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,436
with VoiceOver to navigate

494
00:17:57,436 --> 00:17:59,536
between elements onscreen and I

495
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,726
noticed a couple of things

496
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:00,956
there.

497
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,516
First of all, elements were out

498
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,066
of order.

499
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:05,836
I swiped from one label to the

500
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,296
buttons to the second label.

501
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:09,666
Both labels didn't give me any

502
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,796
indication that I can actually

503
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:12,746
tap on them to go into my own

504
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:13,876
profile and see all my own

505
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:14,416
posts.

506
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,636
And all of those buttons were

507
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,296
missing labels to tell me what

508
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,736
they actually do and what

509
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:20,606
they're meant to be.

510
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:22,706
So, let's keep going.

511
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:25,746
>> Lexi Torres five minutes

512
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:28,296
remaining, just finished my set

513
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:31,106
three comments, two button,

514
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:32,936
three button.

515
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:36,236
>> Now those two buttons have

516
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,436
their values because I'm storing

517
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:39,596
the number of votes in the

518
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,066
buttons text label so VoiceOver

519
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,696
is able to read that, but again

520
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,706
they're unlabeled because I have

521
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,936
no idea what those buttons

522
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,396
actually do, what is the three

523
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,226
ore the two associated with.

524
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:51,146
I'm going to come down here and

525
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:54,196
I'm going to try and focus on

526
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,106
the star view.

527
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:00,266
What you're hearing is VoiceOver

528
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,056
indicating to the user that

529
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,726
there's no accessible element

530
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,706
underneath my finger.

531
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:08,916
And that means that the star

532
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,466
view is not accessible at all so

533
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,956
we're going to need to fix that.

534
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:14,526
>> Button.

535
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:15,976
>> Let's check out the settings

536
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:16,756
page.

537
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,776
>> Settings close button.

538
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:22,526
>> That seems to be labeled

539
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:23,326
properly.

540
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:26,036
>> Facebook, Facebook.

541
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:28,996
>> So, two things I notice here.

542
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:31,436
First of all, the cell isn't

543
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,276
indicating to me whether or not

544
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:34,576
the setting is actually enabled.

545
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,066
And secondly, when I did a

546
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,886
double tap to activate it I

547
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,486
would expect it to enable or

548
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,446
disable the setting and that

549
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,286
didn't happen either.

550
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:44,606
>> Close.

551
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,356
>> Now one other thing I

552
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:46,626
noticed.

553
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,346
>> Tom McNeil.

554
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,746
>> Is that when I was swiping

555
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:53,036
through items on my post it gave

556
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,916
me no indication that I can

557
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,146
actually delete the post.

558
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:59,096
When I'm not using VoiceOver if

559
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,506
I do a long press on one of

560
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:02,296
these cells it brings up an

561
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:03,776
action sheet to initiate a

562
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:03,976
delete.

563
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:08,346
But that interaction isn't clear

564
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:09,936
to a VoiceOver user at all and

565
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:12,376
they have no way of initiating

566
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:14,006
it.

567
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:15,936
>> Alert accessibility short

568
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,936
VoiceOver off.

569
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,406
>> So, let's take a look at some

570
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:21,226
of the basics of our API to

571
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:22,236
solve these problems.

572
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:25,296
Just to recap, this is what we

573
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:25,646
found.

574
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,926
First, we had elements that were

575
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,816
out of order and my profile

576
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:32,306
elements didn't indicate that I

577
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,166
could tap on them to get to my

578
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,626
own profile so it really makes

579
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,546
sense to group them together as

580
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:40,536
a single element that acts as a

581
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:40,876
button.

582
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,766
Next, I have unlabeled buttons

583
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,346
on the top, as well as these on

584
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:47,726
the cell.

585
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,836
The star view was entirely

586
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:57,686
inaccessible, as was initiating

587
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:58,846
a delete of a post.

588
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:03,616
And finally, the settings didn't

589
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:04,576
tell me whether or not they were

590
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:07,956
enabled and an activate of them

591
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:09,216
didn't actually change the

592
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,006
value.

593
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:14,316
So, how do we solve them?

594
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:17,916
Well when a technology like

595
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,196
VoiceOver is trying to get

596
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,876
information about an element for

597
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:23,186
an app, so when a VoiceOver user

598
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:24,506
focuses on an element on the

599
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:26,446
screen it's going to ask a

600
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,686
couple of questions.

601
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,126
Questions like what are you, I'm

602
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:33,606
a button?

603
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:39,786
Who are you, I'm a Notifications

604
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:40,126
button?

605
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:47,136
What's your value, three unread

606
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,946
notifications?

607
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:50,926
Now all of these questions and

608
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,586
answers correspond to properties

609
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:55,436
in code and return specific

610
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:56,576
kinds of return values.

611
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,736
So, let's take a look at this.

612
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:02,636
Here we have the five basic

613
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:04,666
properties in the accessibility

614
00:22:04,846 --> 00:22:06,476
protocol and we're going to go

615
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,566
through them one by one looking

616
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:08,266
at an example.

617
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:11,016
So, the first

618
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:13,696
isAccessibilityElement indicates

619
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:15,866
to a technology like VoiceOver

620
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,596
or Switch Control whether the

621
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:18,856
given element should be visible

622
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:19,756
to VoiceOver at all.

623
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,086
So, if we're looking at the

624
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:26,536
memory view up in the corner

625
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:28,706
there that has a slideshow of

626
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,846
images within the memory, a

627
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,456
label with the title, as well as

628
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,066
a play button that's a great

629
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,996
candidate for making a button,

630
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:38,586
the overall element a button

631
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:41,356
that when I tap on plays the

632
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:41,786
movie.

633
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,626
So, I'm going to set

634
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,206
isAccessibilityElement to be

635
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,056
true on that memory view.

636
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,406
But now because of the way that

637
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:53,226
I've coded this it's possible

638
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,626
that this play button is still

639
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:56,316
going to come up as an

640
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:58,216
accessible element to VoiceOver

641
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:00,126
and because I'm making that

642
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,406
overall element the target

643
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:05,356
instead then I want to set this

644
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,616
play button's is excessively

645
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,186
element to be false so that it

646
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,976
doesn't come up and we don't

647
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:10,896
have redundancy there.

648
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:14,546
And one thing that I forgot to

649
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:18,216
mention is that it's a good idea

650
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:20,696
to make the big area the play

651
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:22,676
button instead because if I'm a

652
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:24,956
VoiceOver user navigating around

653
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,136
this UI with by just feeling my

654
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,096
finger around the screen it's

655
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:31,016
much harder to find that tiny

656
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,516
play button to play the movie

657
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:33,796
than it is to find that big

658
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:34,136
area.

659
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:39,986
Next, we have accessibilityLabel

660
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,326
which describes what an element

661
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:42,846
is.

662
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,096
So, for example with our memory

663
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:47,716
view it's a memory and its title

664
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,866
is February 18th, 2017.

665
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:51,516
So, that seems like a reasonable

666
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:52,146
label.

667
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,826
But now because we're going to

668
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,976
be treating it like a button you

669
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:59,206
might wonder why we don't add

670
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,006
the word button into our label

671
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,876
and that's because of this next

672
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,466
property, accessibilityTraits.

673
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:08,306
This indicates to VoiceOver what

674
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,406
category an element fits into.

675
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,066
So, for example we're going to

676
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,176
set our memory view

677
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:15,776
accessibilityTraits to include

678
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,136
the button trait so that

679
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,496
VoiceOver knows to treat it like

680
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:18,946
a button.

681
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:20,836
This also means that when it

682
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,056
reads the description for the

683
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,546
item it's going to say button at

684
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,906
the end of that so that the user

685
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:26,836
knows what it is.

686
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,656
Now traits are also important

687
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:30,596
for two more reasons.

688
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,966
One, they can afford certain UI

689
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,676
behaviors which you'll see you

690
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:35,876
later in the presentation.

691
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:39,506
And two, there's mechanisms for

692
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:42,126
users to navigate the interface

693
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:44,176
based on specific kinds of items

694
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,766
that will be surfaced based on

695
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:49,186
what traits are associated with

696
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:49,906
it.

697
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,586
Next, we have accessibilityValue

698
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,206
which is for elements that have

699
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:56,236
some form of state.

700
00:24:56,986 --> 00:25:00,296
So, for instance if we're in our

701
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:01,996
memory video and we're editing

702
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:03,476
there's a scrubber along the

703
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,596
bottom that allows me to scrub

704
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:06,726
through the whole video.

705
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,626
And the current valve of that

706
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:12,696
item is the second that I'm

707
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,186
focused on of the elapsed

708
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:15,196
seconds that have already

709
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:15,666
happened.

710
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,586
So, I can set its accessibility

711
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:19,996
value to be that elapsed number

712
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,056
of seconds that I'm currently

713
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:23,126
looking at.

714
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,176
Finally, we have

715
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,896
accessibilityHint.

716
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:29,256
Now this is meant to be a more

717
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:31,446
longform description of how to

718
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,026
interact with an element, what

719
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:35,186
it does or what it's meant for.

720
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:39,266
You can think of this as being a

721
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:41,186
property that allows you to

722
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:42,936
describe to a user that's new to

723
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:45,056
your interface and help them

724
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:47,266
learn how to use your interface.

725
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,556
But it's important that you

726
00:25:49,556 --> 00:25:52,316
never put critical information

727
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,506
to whoever's using it in a hint

728
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:56,856
because hints can actually be

729
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:58,806
disabled to keep VoiceOver from

730
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,166
being too verbose for

731
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:00,976
experienced users.

732
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:09,166
So, going a little further.

733
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:12,056
New this year we have attributed

734
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:14,596
versions of label, value and

735
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:14,876
hint.

736
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,456
And what these allow you to do

737
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:19,766
is pass through specific keys to

738
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:21,686
tweak the way in which VoiceOver

739
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:22,926
speaks a string.

740
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,936
So, for example if I have a

741
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:27,606
string that I know I want to

742
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:28,666
speak -- that's in a different

743
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,196
language and should be spoken

744
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:31,916
with a different voice

745
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,416
synthesizer specific to that

746
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,546
language then I can use the

747
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:37,036
UIAccessibilitySpeech

748
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:39,746
AttributeLanguage key and pass

749
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:41,846
in the correct language code so

750
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:43,376
that when VoiceOver speaks it,

751
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,556
it speaks it with say in this

752
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:47,116
example, the French synthesizer.

753
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,586
Now as well let's say I had an

754
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:54,736
announcement that I wanted to

755
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:57,106
post and speak, but I felt like

756
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:58,836
that announcement isn't

757
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:00,356
important enough to interrupt

758
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:01,436
whatever current speech is

759
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:01,976
happening.

760
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:03,866
Well in this case I can use an

761
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,526
attributed string with the

762
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:07,026
UIAccessibilitySpeech

763
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:09,276
AttributeQueueAnnouncement that

764
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,886
will queue the speech behind

765
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,026
whatever existing speech is

766
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:14,166
already there so that it will be

767
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,096
spoken whatever VoiceOver was

768
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,136
already speaking is done.

769
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:22,046
Also, new this year we have the

770
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:24,026
concept of containers.

771
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:26,406
So previously, when a VoiceOver

772
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:28,806
user would swipe into a

773
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,976
container of some kind they

774
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:31,626
wouldn't really get an

775
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:34,006
indication of what kind of thing

776
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:34,966
they were swiping into, what

777
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,516
does those content actually even

778
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:36,796
mean.

779
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:38,966
So, we're introducing

780
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:41,046
accessibilityContainerType where

781
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:43,036
you can define this and there

782
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,506
are several different kinds of

783
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:45,316
containers.

784
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:48,016
The biggest one there is

785
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,816
dataTable which actually

786
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:51,286
requires conformance to the UI

787
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,576
accessibility container

788
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:56,346
dataTable protocol and improves

789
00:27:56,346 --> 00:27:57,756
the way in which a VoiceOver

790
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,126
user can navigate through your

791
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:00,726
dataTable and understand where

792
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:02,966
they are.

793
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:04,966
So, everything that I just

794
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:08,236
covered there applies to views

795
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:09,926
that you would use through UIKit

796
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:10,413
you.

797
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:14,806
But what if your controls exist

798
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,736
out of UIKit, you have some sort

799
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,026
of non-view element that perhaps

800
00:28:19,026 --> 00:28:20,306
you've drawn using core

801
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:21,046
graphics.

802
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,346
Well in that case we still need

803
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:25,656
to surface those controls to

804
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:29,746
VoiceOver and so we're going to

805
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:33,466
use UI accessibilityElement to

806
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,766
represent logical accessible

807
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:37,006
regions of the screen to

808
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,006
basically stand in for those

809
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:39,626
controls.

810
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,656
So, UI accessibilityElement you

811
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,696
set all the properties that I

812
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:46,556
covered before on it like you

813
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,716
would on any other view and it's

814
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:49,666
initialized with an

815
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,466
accessibility container that

816
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:52,376
would be the view that it's

817
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:53,186
contained in.

818
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:56,516
And then you override on the

819
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:57,446
container the

820
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,266
accessibilityElements protocol

821
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:03,856
which tells VoiceOver what sub

822
00:29:03,856 --> 00:29:06,516
elements within a view are the

823
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:07,566
accessible elements.

824
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,756
And the order in which elements

825
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:12,716
are returned in this array is

826
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:15,336
the order in which VoiceOver

827
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,196
will swipe through them.

828
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:19,906
So that seems like a great

829
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:22,876
candidate for combining those

830
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:24,966
profile elements into a single

831
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:25,386
element.

832
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,576
So, let's come back over to our

833
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:31,206
sample app and take a look at

834
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:32,006
implementing some of these

835
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:32,496
basics.

836
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:45,106
Okay, so I have -- I'm in my

837
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:46,206
home view controller which is

838
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,666
the main screen I'm on and the

839
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,706
first I want to do is fix the

840
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:52,326
labels for those buttons that

841
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:52,976
are up on the top.

842
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,866
So, for the add button I'm going

843
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,216
to say new post because it

844
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:03,196
creates a new post.

845
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:04,996
The notifications button I'm

846
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:05,856
going to set its label to be

847
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:08,506
notifications and its value to

848
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,266
be my current number of unread

849
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,286
notifications.

850
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,186
And then the settings button I'm

851
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:13,976
going to set to be settings.

852
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:19,926
Now I'm going to go take care of

853
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,676
those other unlabeled buttons

854
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:24,736
that were my upload and download

855
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:26,926
buttons.

856
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:31,276
So, for my approved button I'm

857
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:32,586
going to set its label to be up

858
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,256
vote and for my disapprove

859
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:35,436
button down vote.

860
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,216
Now I need to also remember to

861
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,176
change the accessibility value

862
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:42,236
of these buttons whenever my

863
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:43,556
number of approves or number of

864
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:44,766
disapproves changes.

865
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,376
So, when I come into here I'm

866
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:51,076
going to make a switch statement

867
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:52,616
based on number of approves.

868
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,536
When it's one I'm going to say

869
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,046
it's the number of approves vote

870
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:58,006
or when it's more than one I'm

871
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,086
going to day number of approves

872
00:30:59,086 --> 00:30:59,496
votes.

873
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:01,876
And I'm going to do the same

874
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:02,276
thing.

875
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:09,386
For the disapprove.

876
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:13,696
So, let's go to the star view

877
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,306
which was previously

878
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:18,606
inaccessible and we're going to

879
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,826
make that an accessible element.

880
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:26,766
The first thing that we're going

881
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:27,706
to do is override

882
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:29,576
isAccessibilityElement to return

883
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:31,296
true so that VoiceOver knows

884
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:32,266
that this is an element it

885
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,016
should focus on.

886
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:35,446
Going to set its label to be

887
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:37,196
star rating because that's what

888
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:37,546
it is.

889
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,816
And then for its value based on

890
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,886
the number of stars we're going

891
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:44,326
to return either no rating, one

892
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:47,646
star or the current number of

893
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:48,696
stars.

894
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,806
So now let's come back to the

895
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:55,656
home view controller where we

896
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:56,976
had those labels that we wanted

897
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,806
to join together to be a single

898
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,116
element that acted like a

899
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:01,766
button.

900
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,466
So, what we're going to do for

901
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,996
that is a couple things.

902
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,026
We're going to create a UI

903
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,796
accessibilityElement the

904
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,146
container of which is the header

905
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:14,496
view and then we're going to set

906
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:16,566
its label to be my profile name,

907
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:18,266
its value to be my number of

908
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,746
open posts, and its traits to

909
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:22,186
include the button traits so the

910
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,366
user knows that they can

911
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:24,376
interact with it like a button.

912
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:28,296
And then I'm going to find its

913
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:30,696
frame and set this property

914
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,166
accessibilityFrame

915
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,236
InContainerSpace.

916
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:36,076
Now this is important because

917
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:37,396
for a couple reasons.

918
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:39,986
It's telling VoiceOver where the

919
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:42,126
element is onscreen and the

920
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,336
coordinate space of its

921
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,966
container which is used to draw

922
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,736
the bounding box, as well as

923
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:50,246
when a VoiceOver user is feeling

924
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:51,576
around the screen for elements

925
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:53,286
it's using this property to

926
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:54,866
detect whether or not an element

927
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,196
can be found underneath their

928
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:56,486
finger.

929
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,286
Finally, on our header view,

930
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:01,706
we're going to set our

931
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:03,226
accessibilityElements to contain

932
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,846
our new element plus those three

933
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:08,026
buttons that we had already.

934
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:13,306
Last but not least, I want to

935
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:19,036
come to the switch cell and make

936
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:20,406
this the whole cell an

937
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,276
accessibility element and for

938
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:24,206
its value based on whether or

939
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:25,736
not the switch is currently on

940
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,356
I'm going to say on or off as

941
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,356
its accessibility value.

942
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:32,246
So, let me build that to my

943
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:32,656
device.

944
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:46,106
>> VoiceOver on mail, no unread

945
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:46,536
emails.

946
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:48,976
Double tap to open.

947
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,586
Sorry, give me one sec.

948
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:59,226
>> Alert, selected.

949
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:08,476
>> Okay well I have thankfully a

950
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:09,755
premade version of this that

951
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:10,795
actually already has the

952
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:11,786
accessibility in it so we're

953
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,156
going to launch that and I'm

954
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:15,366

view, it's actually a view now.

976
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:02,606

whether or not my setting is

currently off or on.

982
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:16,866
Now there are a couple of

983
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,566
problems that we found during

984
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,626
our audit that we still haven't

985
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:21,646
actually fixed.

986
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:23,616
I still have no way of bringing

987
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:24,536
up the delete sheet.

988
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:28,326
I have no way of actually

989
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,556
changing the value of the star

990
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:31,456
rating view.

991
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:34,046
I can see what it is, I can see

992
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:36,186
what the current number stars

993
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:36,976
is, but I have no way of

994
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:37,596
changing it.

995
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:40,046
And when I double tap on my

996
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:41,166
setting it's still not changing

997
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:41,926
that setting value.

998
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,746
So, the first thing I want to

999
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:47,886
look at are custom actions.

1000
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:52,146
So, we're going to use these to

1001
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:53,666
bring up that delete sheet in

1002
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,346
our sample app.

1003
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:57,126
Basically, a custom action is

1004
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:58,996
something that you add to an

1005
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:01,316
element that is an action that

1006
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:04,286
it has available to it.

1007
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:07,866
So, views have the property

1008
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,846
accessibilityCustomActions which

1009
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:11,646
you can override with an array

1010
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,826
of UI accessibilityCustomAction

1011
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:16,236
that are all of the actions

1012
00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:16,866
available to it.

1013
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,376
So, what does an action look

1014
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:18,576
like?

1015
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:21,876
Well it has a name for instance,

1016
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,266
our delete action is called

1017
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,986
delete because it tells the user

1018
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:27,686
what it does and it has a target

1019
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,096
and a selector that get called

1020
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,076
whenever that action is

1021
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:30,696
initiated.

1022
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,346
So, when a view has custom

1023
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:38,606
actions it's going to tell that

1024
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:41,176
to the user and then the user

1025
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,606
can swipe up or down with their

1026
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:44,836
finger to cycle through the

1027
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,616
current actions of that element.

1028
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,016
And when they land on the one

1029
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,216
that they want to activate a

1030
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,246
double tap instead of doing

1031
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,276
whatever the default behavior

1032
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,106
will do will initiate that

1033
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:54,536
action.

1034
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:57,626
So, for instance, with our

1035
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,046
delete we can create a custom

1036
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:02,106
action called delete, set our

1037
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:04,046
self as the target with our

1038
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,536
delete cell action method that

1039
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:08,046
returns a Boolean and that calls

1040
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:10,296
the code for actually initiating

1041
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:11,146
the delete of the cell.

1042
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:13,836
On our cell, we're going to

1043
00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:14,436
override

1044
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:16,606
accessibilityCustomActions to

1045
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:17,936
contain this custom action.

1046
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:20,836
Now because we're overriding it

1047
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:22,796
on the cell and the cell itself

1048
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,356
isn't an accessibilityElement,

1049
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:25,606
all of its sub elements are.

1050
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,616
All of its sub elements are

1051
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:29,246
going to inherit the custom

1052
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,946
actions of its parent.

1053
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,196
So, I can actually initiate this

1054
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:34,956
delete action from any of the

1055
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:37,996
views on the cell.

1056
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,406
Next, we have the default

1057
00:37:40,406 --> 00:37:41,066
activation.

1058
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:42,946
So, what if we want to actually

1059
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:44,486
override what the default

1060
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:46,516
behavior is when a VoiceOver

1061
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:47,956
user double taps on an element.

1062
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:49,626
And that's what we're going to

1063
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:51,186
use to fix the problem of

1064
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,086
actually changing our settings.

1065
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:56,686
What you can do is override

1066
00:37:56,686 --> 00:37:58,996
accessibilityActivate, which

1067
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:01,336
returns a Boolean indicating

1068
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:02,806
whether or not the activation

1069
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:03,506
was successful.

1070
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:07,956
So, for example with our switch

1071
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:10,226
cells we can override

1072
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:12,626
accessibilityActivate and set

1073
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,306
whether or not the switch is on

1074
00:38:14,736 --> 00:38:16,546
based on its current on value.

1075
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,176
And we're always going to return

1076
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:19,806
true because we know that that

1077
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:21,096
action is always going to be

1078
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:21,666
successful.

1079
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:26,446
Next, we have adjustable

1080
00:38:26,446 --> 00:38:29,286
elements, so our star rating is

1081
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:32,666
adjustable and VoiceOver has a

1082
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:35,076
mechanism for adjustable

1083
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:36,886
elements to respond to increment

1084
00:38:36,886 --> 00:38:37,816
and decrement calls.

1085
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:41,956
So, the first thing we want to

1086
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:43,796
return in that element's traits

1087
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,536
that it is an adjustable element

1088
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:48,296
and that tells VoiceOver that

1089
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,056
element is going to respond to

1090
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:52,156
the accessibilityIncrement and

1091
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,966
decrement calls which we can

1092
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:57,046
override to do whatever behavior

1093
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:58,536
we need when we increment and

1094
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:58,976
decrement.

1095
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:02,486
And a user adjusts an adjustable

1096
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,166
element by swiping up and down

1097
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:04,766
with their finger.

1098
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:07,626
Up as an increment, down as a

1099
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:08,636
decrement.

1100
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:12,066
So, with our star's view we have

1101
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:13,706
the number of stars that

1102
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:15,946
whenever it's set has code that

1103
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:17,206
actually adjusts the view

1104
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:17,916
itself.

1105
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:20,516
In its traits, we're going to

1106
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:22,166
include the adjustable trait.

1107
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,846
And in increment we're simply

1108
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:25,906
going to increase the number of

1109
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:28,186
stars by one and in decrement

1110
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:29,356
we're going to decrease the

1111
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,156
number of stars by one and now

1112
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,976
that element is fully accessible

1113
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:34,186
to our VoiceOver users.

1114
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,176
Now I'd like to look at a

1115
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:38,416
different problem that we didn't

1116
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,796
see in our sample app.

1117
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:44,416
So, VoiceOver has this concept

1118
00:39:44,496 --> 00:39:46,976
of pass-through which happens

1119
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:49,376
when a VoiceOver user double

1120
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:51,566
taps and holds their finger and

1121
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:53,846
it passes through the panning

1122
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:55,986
gesture so I can actually run my

1123
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:58,626
finger across the screen and get

1124
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,016
a more fine adjustment of a

1125
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:01,996
slider like you see in this

1126
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:02,946
photo's page here.

1127
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:06,716
But we want a way to tell

1128
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:08,966
VoiceOver where it should

1129
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,626
actually focus that panning when

1130
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,796
I initiate it because if I'm a

1131
00:40:13,796 --> 00:40:16,106
VoiceOver user then I probably

1132
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:19,056
am not going to be able to

1133
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:21,376
accurately land my finger on

1134
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,346
that little sliding nub in the

1135
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:25,796
center right, I don't actually

1136
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:27,736
know where it is.

1137
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:28,796
So, we're going to use

1138
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:31,326
accessibilityActivationPoint

1139
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:33,726
which is the point that tells

1140
00:40:33,726 --> 00:40:35,106
VoiceOver when a pass-through

1141
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:38,666
occurs, what part of the UI do

1142
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:40,336
you actually want to hook into.

1143
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:43,456
So, for instance, if we have our

1144
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:45,986
slider view where we have some

1145
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,336
sort of slider nub then we can

1146
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:49,026
override

1147
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:51,016
accessibilityActivationPoint to

1148
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,376
be the center of that nub so

1149
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:54,966
that whenever the user passes

1150
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:57,196
through that gesture it will

1151
00:40:57,196 --> 00:40:58,636
hook into the center of the nub

1152
00:40:58,636 --> 00:40:59,606
and start sliding there.

1153
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:04,736
Next, we have custom scrolling,

1154
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:09,096
so you may have views that have

1155
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:10,936
swipe gestures on them that you

1156
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,926
can use to get to different

1157
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:13,616
parts of the UI.

1158
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:15,596
For instance, in photos if I

1159
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,166
swipe up then I get to my

1160
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:17,916
details.

1161
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,546
And there's a way that we can

1162
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:21,866
get this behavior for VoiceOver

1163
00:41:21,866 --> 00:41:22,666
users as well.

1164
00:41:24,136 --> 00:41:26,066
It's called an

1165
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,826
accessibilityScroll, it's

1166
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:29,296
initiated by scrolling with

1167
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:31,296
three fingers when VoiceOver is

1168
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:31,686
on.

1169
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:33,616
And it returns a Boolean to

1170
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,176
indicate whether or not the

1171
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:36,316
scroll was successful.

1172
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:37,946
And it passes through a

1173
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:40,216
direction so that you can change

1174
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:41,226
the behavior based on what

1175
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:43,066
direction the user is scrolling.

1176
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,186
So, for example with our image

1177
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:47,676
view if we wanted to show

1178
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:48,996
details like we do in the Photos

1179
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:52,106
app we'd have some property that

1180
00:41:52,106 --> 00:41:53,276
tells us whether or not we can

1181
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:54,836
currently show the details and

1182
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,286
we have code that actually goes

1183
00:41:57,286 --> 00:41:58,676
through and shows those details.

1184
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:00,826
And so, what we're going to do

1185
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:02,786
is override accessibilityScroll,

1186
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:05,966
we're going to check can we show

1187
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:08,676
our details and are we scrolling

1188
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,096
in the right position or

1189
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:11,596
direction.

1190
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:15,166
And if we do we're going to show

1191
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,806
our details and return true,

1192
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:20,716
otherwise we're going to return

1193
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:21,136
false.

1194
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,346
And when I return false

1195
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,126
VoiceOver is going to make a

1196
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,926
bonking noise to indicate to the

1197
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:29,366
user that whatever swipe that

1198
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:30,696
they just did was not a valid

1199
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:31,026
swipe.

1200
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:35,876
Now I'm not going to go through

1201
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,666
actually adding all those things

1202
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:40,416
into our sample app, but they

1203
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,806
are in the finished version of

1204
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:43,606
the sample which you can find

1205
00:42:43,606 --> 00:42:45,516
and download at this URL.

1206
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:47,206
And I recommend that you go and

1207
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:48,976
check it out and see how that

1208
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:50,536
code is implemented and see how

1209
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:51,956
it works in action, play around

1210
00:42:51,956 --> 00:42:52,476
with it yourself.

1211
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,506
Instead, I'd like to spend a

1212
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:58,416
little bit of time talking about

1213
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:58,986
Drag-and-Drop.

1214
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:02,256
So, for those of you that missed

1215
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:04,356
it at the keynote we unveiled

1216
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:06,186
Drag-and-Drop finally coming to

1217
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:09,416
iOS where I can drag pieces of

1218
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,146
content and drop it in other

1219
00:43:11,146 --> 00:43:12,426
places in the interface.

1220
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,126
For instance, if I have photos

1221
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:16,256
open next to notes I can drag a

1222
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:18,656
photo and drop it into one of my

1223
00:43:18,656 --> 00:43:19,116
notes.

1224
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:22,376
Now because this was just

1225
00:43:22,376 --> 00:43:24,486
unveiled two days ago I don't

1226
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:26,106
really expect all of you to

1227
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,786
already understand how that API

1228
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:28,196
works.

1229
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:31,136
But there are just two key

1230
00:43:31,136 --> 00:43:32,456
concepts that you need to

1231
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:33,766
understand before I talk about

1232
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:36,336
the accessibility and that's

1233
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,646
drag sources and drop points.

1234
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:41,266
So, drag sources are all the

1235
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:43,186
points on my view that I can

1236
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:45,476
initiate a drag from and drop

1237
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:46,896
points conversely are all the

1238
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:48,416
places on my view that I can

1239
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,136
drop content.

1240
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:53,076
So, for instance, on the Home

1241
00:43:53,076 --> 00:43:54,686
screen which now uses

1242
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:56,116
Drag-and-Drop for rearranging

1243
00:43:56,116 --> 00:44:00,496
icons I have three drop points

1244
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:03,026
for each app when I'm moving

1245
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:03,346
another.

1246
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,896
The first is the left drop point

1247
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:10,726
which allows me to drop the app

1248
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:11,936
I'm currently moving to the left

1249
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:12,976
and shift everything else to the

1250
00:44:12,976 --> 00:44:13,286
right.

1251
00:44:13,286 --> 00:44:16,306
I have the center drop point

1252
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:18,016
that will create a folder

1253
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:19,116
between the two apps.

1254
00:44:19,336 --> 00:44:20,846
And I have the right drop point

1255
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:23,256
that will drop my current app to

1256
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:23,646
the right.

1257
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:28,156
And we need a way of describing

1258
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:31,376
those different drag sources and

1259
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:33,136
drop points to our VoiceOver

1260
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:33,686
users.

1261
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:35,846
And to do that we're going to

1262
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:37,566
use this new API

1263
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,396
accessibilityDrag

1264
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:40,876
SourcesDescriptors and

1265
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:42,266
accessibilityDrop

1266
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,236
PointDescriptors.

1267
00:44:43,786 --> 00:44:44,956
They're arrays of

1268
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:45,966
UIAccessibility

1269
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:48,216
LocationDescriptor that

1270
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:50,136
described the drags and the

1271
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:51,126
drops for review.

1272
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,176
So, we create a UIAccessibility

1273
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,196
LocationDescriptor for each

1274
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:57,826
drag-and-drop.

1275
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,966
The view is going to be the view

1276
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:02,916
that has the drag or drop

1277
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,396
interaction associated with it.

1278
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:08,576
The point is the point where the

1279
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:09,876
drag is initiated from or the

1280
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,236
drop is associated with.

1281
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:13,856
And the name is meant to

1282
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,136
describe what that drag or drop

1283
00:45:16,276 --> 00:45:16,776
does.

1284
00:45:17,116 --> 00:45:18,486
And there's even an attributed

1285
00:45:18,486 --> 00:45:20,576
name where you can use all those

1286
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:21,716
attributed keys that I was

1287
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:23,546
referring to earlier to tweak

1288
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:25,846
the way that VoiceOver describes

1289
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:28,826
the name of the descriptor.

1290
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:31,026
So, let's take a look at how

1291
00:45:31,026 --> 00:45:31,956
this works in code.

1292
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:34,176
Now this is just a hypothetical

1293
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:35,346
example this isn't an actually

1294
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:36,056
springboard code.

1295
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:38,016
But let's say that I was

1296
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:40,736
implementing rearranging apps

1297
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:42,816
and I have a method that returns

1298
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,516
an app view for a given index

1299
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:44,726
path.

1300
00:45:46,096 --> 00:45:47,026
Well I'm going to start by

1301
00:45:47,026 --> 00:45:48,926
initializing that app view and

1302
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:50,816
then I'm going to create a drag

1303
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,696
descriptor and I'm going to give

1304
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:55,086
it the name drag whatever the

1305
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,446
app name is because that's what

1306
00:45:56,446 --> 00:45:56,856
I'm doing.

1307
00:45:57,456 --> 00:45:59,116
And then the center of where the

1308
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:00,866
app is dragged from or sorry the

1309
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:01,796
point where the app is dragged

1310
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:03,126
from is its center.

1311
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:05,496
And the view that actually has

1312
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,036
that drag interaction is myself.

1313
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,866
Then I'm going to override the

1314
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:12,456
app view's drag source

1315
00:46:12,456 --> 00:46:14,436
descriptors to include that new

1316
00:46:14,626 --> 00:46:15,336
drag descriptor.

1317
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:17,756
Now let's look at the drops.

1318
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,716
So, first of all, we need to

1319
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:22,696
identify the points on my app

1320
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,586
view where I actually want to

1321
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:25,726
use the drop, the left and the

1322
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:26,956
right point, I know where the

1323
00:46:26,956 --> 00:46:27,686
center is already.

1324
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:30,476
And I'm going to create a

1325
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:31,676
descriptor for each of those.

1326
00:46:32,106 --> 00:46:33,676
My leftDescriptor I'm going to

1327
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:35,456
say drop left of blank,

1328
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:38,556
folderDescriptor I'm going to

1329
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:40,416
say create a folder with the app

1330
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:43,006
and the rightDescriptor drop

1331
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:43,706
right of the app.

1332
00:46:44,246 --> 00:46:46,366
And then I'm going to override

1333
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:47,416
accessibilityDrop

1334
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,196
PointDescriptors to include all

1335
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:51,826
those new descriptors and I'll

1336
00:46:51,826 --> 00:46:52,646
return my app view.

1337
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:55,686
And that's it, pretty simple.

1338
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:59,176
But important to convey for the

1339
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:00,696
VoiceOver user what each of your

1340
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,196
Drag-and-Drop interactions are

1341
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:02,576
like.

1342
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:04,606
So, if you're going to implement

1343
00:47:04,606 --> 00:47:06,936
this feature then please take

1344
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:08,216
the time to do the accessibility

1345
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:11,026
for it as well.

1346
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:14,936
Now I talked about a lot of

1347
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:16,896
stuff today, we looked at some

1348
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:19,446
new features, we looked at

1349
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:20,946
auditing your own app for

1350
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:23,466
accessibility, and we looked at

1351
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,156
various portions of our API to

1352
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:26,506
solve the problems that you find

1353
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:27,126
while auditing.

1354
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:30,416
And that's all great technical

1355
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,506
stuff, but I want to bring it

1356
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:35,096
back to the beginning to remind

1357
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:37,056
you why we're all actually in

1358
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:37,596
this room.

1359
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:42,146
Accessibility is about people,

1360
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:46,696
the common person's life is

1361
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:49,456
enhanced by technology, but for

1362
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:51,656
people with disabilities it's

1363
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:52,416
transformative.

1364
00:47:53,806 --> 00:47:55,486
Accessible technology enables

1365
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:57,466
people to live their lives the

1366
00:47:57,466 --> 00:48:00,336
way that they want to, to

1367
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,746
accomplish goals and tasks that

1368
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:06,246
were once unattainable, to have

1369
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:08,026
jobs and roles in their

1370
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:10,276
communities that they couldn't

1371
00:48:10,276 --> 00:48:13,596
have had before, and to interact

1372
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:15,136
with the world in ways that were

1373
00:48:15,136 --> 00:48:16,396
once impossible.

1374
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:21,196
The work that you do to ensure

1375
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:23,066
that your apps work for everyone

1376
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:24,226
is critical.

1377
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:28,006
So, we thank you for the amazing

1378
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,756
work that you've already done,

1379
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:31,796
that you will continue to do,

1380
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,556
and that you will start today as

1381
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:36,546
we work together to make Apple's

1382
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,096
platforms more inclusive.

1383
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:43,246
Now for more information, you

1384
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:44,646
can go to this URL where we've

1385
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,696
collected some URLs that are

1386
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:47,706
helpful for you like some

1387
00:48:47,706 --> 00:48:48,956
developer documentation, as well

1388
00:48:48,956 --> 00:48:50,286
as our accessibility website.

1389
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:53,026
And there are a couple of

1390
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:54,276
related sessions, there are the

1391
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:55,396
three sessions related to

1392
00:48:55,396 --> 00:48:56,626
dynamic type that I covered

1393
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:58,896
before, and there's a media and

1394
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:01,496
gaming accessibility talk

1395
00:49:02,136 --> 00:49:03,546
specifically for apps related to

1396
00:49:03,546 --> 00:49:05,476
media and gaming that's in this

1397
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,236
room right after I'm done.

1398
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:09,826
Thank you very much, have a

1399
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:10,846
great rest of your conference.
