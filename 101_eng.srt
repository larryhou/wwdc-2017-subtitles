quickly glancing at information.

226

information shows up here.

230
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,246
So for example weather, calendar

type of intelligence we've

see a reminder to make a call

279
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,466

430
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,476
it has data the Apple Watch

431
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:02,726
doesn't have and the watch has

432

data the gym equipment doesn't

433

It's not about blocking ads, the

771
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,336
but your privacy is protected.

00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,256
Next, I want to talk about some

773
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:11,726
refinements to Mail and it

774
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:12,866
starts with search.

775
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:14,346
So in addition to providing

776
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,156
searches based on recency,

777
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,486
search in Mail is now using

778
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:20,296
Spotlight to identify your top

00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:21,536
So the message you're looking

781
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,246
for is almost always right there

782

792
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:40,736
It actually uses 35% less disk

793

00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,596
Now, probably our biggest area

795
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:46,826
of refinement in High Sierra is

00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:56,226
a new view that has all your

00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:26,276
many editing operations.

956
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:27,686
And, of course, we even use

957
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,776
Metal inside of photos for doing

958
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,086
machine learning in identifying

959
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:31,706
your photos.

960
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:33,846
But we've learned a lot working

961
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:34,806
with developers and their

962
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,436
adoption of Metal and we have a

963
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:37,826
new version to announce today.

964
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:39,186
And you'll never guess what we

965
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:39,636
called it.

966
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:40,976
It's Metal 2.

967
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:42,966
[ Laughter ]

968
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,806
Now, Metal 2 is tremendously

969
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:46,326
fast.

970
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:47,596
In fact, it has great

971
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,456
optimizations and new APIs that

972
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:52,146
when adopted, deliver another 10

973
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:54,076
times improvement in draw call

974
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:54,676
throughput.

975
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:55,726
Now, some of you remember when

976
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,466
Metal first came out, it itself

977
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:58,746
had a 10 times improvement over

978
00:30:58,746 --> 00:30:59,286
OpenGL.

979
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,736
You can multiply those numbers

980
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:01,096
together.

981
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,396
That's a hundred times

982
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:03,016
improvement.

983
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,216
Now, we've also provided

984
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:09,366
better-- sorry, debugging and

985
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,066
performance analysis tools for

986
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:12,096
you to optimize your app for

987
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:12,406
Metal.

988
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:14,176
And we're so excited about the

989
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,086
advances in Metal 2 that we've

990
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:18,326
taken the Mac Window Server and

991
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:19,796
put it on top of Metal,

992
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,666
accelerating things like Mission

993
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,296
Control.

994
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:23,616
And some of our most challenging

995
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:24,846
system animations are now

996
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,026
buttery smooth all the time.

997
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,546
Now, Metal is not just about

998
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,146
graphics.

999
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:32,246
We're also using it for machine

1000
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:32,836
learning.

1001
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:34,946
It can now accelerate-- yes, we

1002
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,636
have Metal performance shaders

1003
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:38,836
to accelerate all kinds of deep

1004
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:39,916
learning algorithms.

1005
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:41,866
Another piece of Metal news

1006
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,216
today is Metal for external

1007
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:44,936
graphics.

1008
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,266
So, you know our MacBooks have

1009
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:50,146
this tremendous balance of

1010
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,026
portability and power.

1011
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:54,106
But sometimes for some

1012
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:56,006
workflows, you need even more

1013
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:56,246
power.

1014
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,706
You want to take advantage of

1015
00:31:57,706 --> 00:32:00,366
the incredible Thunderbolt IO on

1016
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,556
your MacBook Pros to access

1017
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,046
external graphics.

1018
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:05,966
So we're going to be making this

1019
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,186
possible in Metal 2.

1020
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:09,416
Now, we're starting with the

1021
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,376
Developer Kit that will be

1022
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:11,316
available today.

1023
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,296
You can actually order a

1024
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:14,746
Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with a

1025
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,956
high-performance AMD GPU and

1026
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:19,616
tune your apps for

1027
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:20,866
high-performance external

1028
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:21,356
graphics.

1029
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,766
And then we'll be rolling out

1030
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,716
support to all of our customers

1031
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:26,046
in the months to come.

1032
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,216
Now, with these graphics power,

1033
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:30,716
we're really doubling down on

1034
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:31,996
our focus on Pro content

1035
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:32,536
creation.

1036
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:34,756
And that's increasingly about VR

1037
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,896
content creation.

1038
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:40,666
And so, we're bringing Metal for

1039
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:41,766
VR to High Sierra.

[ Applause ]

1041
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:47,686

1042
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:50,526
VR-optimized display pipeline

1043
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:51,806
that provides extremely high

1044
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:52,626
performance.

1045
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,196
And we're optimizing our Pro

1046
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:56,406
apps like Final Cut for doing

1047
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:57,536
things like editing spherical

1048
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:59,136
video right inside the VR

1049
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,626
environment.

1050
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:01,946
We're also working with Valve.

1051
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,476
They're bringing the SteamVR,

1052
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:04,236
SVK to the Mac.

1053
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,896
And we work with Unity and

1054
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:09,676
Unreal to bring their engines

1055
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,276
for VR to the Mac.

from us later today on this

1060
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:21,266
topic.

1061
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:24,146
So that's a quick look at macOS.

1062
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,926
Some great technologies with the

1063
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:28,956
Apple File System, HEVC Video

1064
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:30,966
and incredible graphics with

1065
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:33,306
Metal 2 support for external

1066
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:35,286

1067
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:37,436
Mac and, of course, a bunch of

1068
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:38,886
fantastic refinements.

1069
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:41,176
Now, macOS High Sierra is

1070
00:33:41,176 --> 00:33:43,646

[ Applause and Cheering ]

1087
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:16,466
>> Thank you, Craig.

1088
00:34:17,616 --> 00:34:19,686
So, we have some great updates

1089
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,176
to talk about today that span

1090
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,666
much of the Mac product line.

1091
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:24,346
And let's begin with the iMac.

1092
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:27,246
Now, the iMac has been the gold

1093
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:28,786
standard of desktops for many

1094
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:30,076
years but we're going to raise

1095
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:31,315
the bar once again.

1096
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:33,315
And as always on the iMac, it

1097
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:34,496
starts with the display.

1098
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,275
Because the 4K and 5K Retina

1099
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:38,835
iMac displays with their high

1100
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:40,626
resolution, excellent brightness

1101
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,795
and P3 color gamut, are the best

1102
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:44,286
displays on any desktop.

1103
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:45,706
But we're going to make them

1104
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:46,275
even better.

1105
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,775
So these new displays are now

1106
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:50,335
going to be 500 nits.

1107
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:52,275
That's 43% brighter than the

1108
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:53,196
previous generation.

1109
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:55,456
And for the first time, we're

1110
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:56,545
going to support 10-bit

1111
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:57,856
dithering, which means these

1112
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:59,206
displays can reproduce up to a

1113
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:00,416
billion colors.

1114
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:02,776
So, your content is going to

1115
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:04,236
look more true to life than ever

1116
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:04,666
before.

1117
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:06,976
Now, in addition, we've got some

1118
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:08,456
great internal updates for these

1119
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:08,906
iMacs.

1120
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:10,496
So we'll start with the CPU

1121
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:11,826
because the whole line is moving

1122
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:13,666
to Intel's 7th-generation Core

1123
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,546
Processor, also known as Kaby

1124
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:15,776
Lake.

1125
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,486
Now, Kaby Lake gets this better

1126
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:19,216
base and turbo frequencies for

1127
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,856
more performance as well as

1128
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,166
hardware-based 10-bit HEVC

1129
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,586
decode which is great for

1130
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:25,966
playing back high quality video.

1131
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,316
In addition, these iMacs are

1132
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:29,396
getting a boost when it comes to

1133
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,366
memory capacity.

1134
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:32,996
So the 21.5-inch systems can now

1135
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,766
be configured with up to 32 gigs

1136
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:35,236
of memory.

1137
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:37,176
And the 27-inch can go all the

1138
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,566
way up to 64 gigabytes of

1139
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:38,936
memory.

1140
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,446
Both of those are twice what the

1141
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:41,656
previous generation can do.

1142
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,466
Now, fast storage has always

1143
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:45,986
been a key part of the iMac.

1144
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:47,076
And so, we're going to now make

1145
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:49,166
our Fusion Drive standard on all

1146
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,276
27-inch configs.

1147
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:51,606
And it's also going to be

1148
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:52,806
standard on the high-end

1149
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:54,566
21.5-inch config as well.

1150
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,366
In addition, our SSD options are

1151
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,426
going to be up to 50% faster and

1152
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,336
now available up to 2 terabytes.

1153
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,426
And the iMacs are getting an IO

1154
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:05,436
upgrade as well because we're

1155
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,706
giving them two USB-C connectors

1156
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,246
which support Thunderbolt 3.

1157
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:10,636
And we think our customers

1158
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,106
especially our Pro users are

1159
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:12,936
really going to love this

1160
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:13,926
because you can do some cool

1161
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,246
things like hook up a

1162
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,966
high-performance RAID array and

1163
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,866
an external 5K display at the

1164
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,126
same time.

1165
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:21,966
So now, let's talk about

1166
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:22,496
graphics.

1167
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:23,906
And as you heard earlier, we're

1168
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,386
investing heavily in graphic

1169
00:36:25,386 --> 00:36:26,976
software technologies like Metal

1170
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:27,426
2.

1171
00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:29,206
Well, we're also investing in

1172
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:30,166
graphics hardware.

1173
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,926
And every configuration in this

1174
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,236
new iMac line is going to get a

1175
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,066
big bump in its graphics

1176
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:35,706
performance.

1177
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,096
So we'll start with the

1178
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:37,906
entry-level iMac.

1179
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:39,496
Now this system gets a boost in

1180
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:41,386
its integrated GPU by way of

1181
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:43,206
Intel's Iris Plus Graphics which

1182
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,166
now has 64 megabytes of eDRAM.

1183
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,626
And the performance that we're

1184
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:47,546
getting out of this is pretty

1185
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:49,096
amazing because this system is

1186
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:51,196
up to 80% faster in graphics

1187
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:51,946
than the previous generation.

1188
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:56,306
[ Applause and Cheering ]

1189
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:59,296
Now next up is the 21.5-inch

1190
00:36:59,436 --> 00:37:01,296
iMac with Retina 4K display.

1191
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,936
And the big news here is that

1192
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,056
we're going to be moving to

1193
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,516
discrete graphics and making it

1194
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:07,636
standard on all 4K iMacs.

1195
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,376
And that's going to come-- There

1196
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:09,576
you go.

1197
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:10,936
And that's going to come in this

1198
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:13,356
Radeon Pro series GPUs with up

1199
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,026
to 4 gigabytes of VRAM.

1200
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:17,106
And again, this move to discrete

1201
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:18,046
graphics yield to pretty

1202
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,576
spectacular performance increase

1203
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:21,616
because this new system is up to

1204
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,256
three times faster than the

1205
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,286
previous generation for

1206
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:24,956
graphics.

1207
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:28,726
[ Applause and Cheering ]

1208
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,366
Now, lastly, we have our 27-inch

00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:31,716
iMAc.

1210
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,936

desktop for our Pro customers.

1212
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,206
So obviously, it's going to get

1213
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:37,346
a bump in graphics today as

1214
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:37,656
well.

1215
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:38,996
So it's going to have this

1216

Radeon Pro 500 series GPUs with

1217
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:43,246
up to 8 gigabytes of VRAM.

1218
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:45,186
And again, we get a great

1219
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:45,976
performance uplift.

1220
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:47,686

1221
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:50,186
now deliver up to 5.5 teraflops

00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,996
airflow than a traditional iMac.

1513
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:05,686
In fact, the iMac Pro has a

1514
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:07,606
greater than 80% increase in

1515
00:47:07,606 --> 00:47:08,526
cooling capacity.

1516
00:47:08,976 --> 00:47:10,096
So that means we can deliver

1517
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:11,866
unbelievable performance while

1518
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:13,116
still maintaining the quiet

1519
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:14,526
operation you'd expect from an

1520
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:14,916
iMac.

1521
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:16,476
So let's talk about what's

1522
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:17,686
inside and I want to start with

1523
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:19,036
the CPU because we wanted to go

1524
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:19,976
really big here.

1525
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:22,416
So the iMac Pro is going to ship

1526
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,526
with an 8-core Xeon processor.

1528
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:30,696
But it's also going to ship with

1529
00:47:30,696 --> 00:47:32,686
a 10-core Xeon processor.

[ Applause ]

1531
00:47:35,196 --> 00:47:36,226
And then we thought, you know,

1532
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:37,946
we've gone this far, let's get

1533
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:38,516
really nutty.

1534
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,976
So we're going to offer it with

1535
00:47:39,976 --> 00:47:41,156
up to 18-core.

1536
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:44,996
[ Applause and Cheering ]

1537
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,506
That is a ton of compute power.

1538
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:49,026
But we didn't want to stop there

1539
00:47:49,026 --> 00:47:50,026
because we wanted to go really

1540
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:51,476
big on graphics as well.

1541
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,216
So the iMac Pro is going to use

1542
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:55,756
AMD's Radeon Vega graphics.

1543
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:57,796
This is a brand new workstation

1544
00:47:57,796 --> 00:47:59,206
class graphics architecture.

1545
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:01,276
It features a completely new GPU

1546
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:03,176
core and high bandwidth on

1547
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:03,916
packaged memory.

1548
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,856
It's going to be available with

1549
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:08,236
up to 16 gigabytes of VRAM and

1550
00:48:08,236 --> 00:48:10,476
over 400 gigabytes per second of

1551
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:11,246
memory bandwidth.

1552
00:48:11,246 --> 00:48:12,596
And we aren't going to use an

1553
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:14,036
entry level configuration here

1554
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:15,836
because our implementation is

1555
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:16,986
going to offer up to 11

1556
00:48:16,986 --> 00:48:18,706
teraflops of single precision

1557
00:48:18,706 --> 00:48:19,396
compute power.

1558
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:21,256
That's three times more than the

1559
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:22,936
best GPU in the Mac Pro.

1560
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:24,786
But it actually gets even better

1561
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:26,676
because this Radeon Vega GPU can

1562
00:48:26,676 --> 00:48:28,526
also do half precision compute.

1563
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,276
So that means the iMac Pro can

1564
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:33,536
deliver up to 22 teraflops of

1565
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,956
half precision computation.

1566
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:37,886
This is a really big deal for

1567
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:39,086
things like machine learning

1568
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:39,616
development.

1569
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,526
So the iMac Pro as you can see

1570
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:42,786
is going to be a monster when it

1571
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,346
comes to graphics, but we didn't

1572
00:48:44,346 --> 00:48:45,366
want to stop there either.

1573
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:46,396
So we're going to let you

1574
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:48,376

Now, the iMac Pro is also going

1582
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:06,466
to have a full complement of

1583

high performance I/O including

1584
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:10,206
four Thunderbolt 3 ports and for

And with all that cutting edge

1589

I/O, you can do some pretty

1590
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:22,786
amazing things.

1591
00:49:22,786 --> 00:49:24,846

could ever do that.

1595
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:30,316
And when you combine that with

1596
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:32,096
the internal display, that means

1597
00:49:32,096 --> 00:49:34,896
the iMac Pro can drive up to 44

00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:35,826

1618

We have a lot to talk about.

00:52:56,516 --> 00:52:57,956
We're going to start with

Messages.

1700
00:52:59,186 --> 00:53:01,446
Now, you all know in iOS 10, we

1701
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:04,676
had iMessage apps and stickers.

1702

these.

1704
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,386
And now in iOS 11, we're making

them more discoverable and ever

1706
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,556
with this redesigned app drawer.

1707

You can see you have your apps

scroll through them and tap into

It's really easy.

Now, the big story with messages

00:53:26,356 --> 00:53:28,316
though is messages in iCloud.

1719
00:53:28,746 --> 00:53:30,656
Because now with your iMessages

In fact, they stay in sync.

embarrassing message that you

1728
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:47,706
don't want in your transcript,

well it goes away everywhere,

to optimize your device storage

1733
00:53:55,446 --> 00:53:56,466
because with your messages in

1734
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,866
the cloud, we only need to keep

1735
00:53:57,866 --> 00:53:59,746
your most recent messages cached

1736
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:01,096
on the device and so that makes

1737
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:02,966
for smaller and faster backups

Pokemon Go is from Niantic.

2461
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:48,766
From the beginning, we've had

2462
01:15:48,766 --> 01:15:50,916
two very important goals, to

2463
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,556
make the App Store a trusted and

2464
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:55,056
safe place for users and to make

2465
01:15:55,056 --> 01:15:57,436
it a great opportunity for all

done a lot of great things to

01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:04,966

2472
01:16:04,966 --> 01:16:06,656

Yes. I'm sure you're well aware

2479
01:16:19,056 --> 01:16:20,116
that the majority of apps are

2480
01:16:20,116 --> 01:16:22,116
all now reviewed in under 24

2483
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:25,496
The team is going to keep

2484
01:16:25,496 --> 01:16:26,386
working hard at that.

I've highlighted a bunch of

2488
01:16:31,106 --> 01:16:31,826
things here.

2489
01:16:31,986 --> 01:16:33,406
I'll just point out one of them.

2490
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,946
You can read some of your

2491
01:16:34,946 --> 01:16:36,096
favorite things up there.

2492
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:37,316
A big request in developers is

2493
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:38,836
called phased releases.

2494
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:39,516
Now when you--

2495
01:16:39,626 --> 01:16:39,796
>> Woo!

2496
01:16:39,796 --> 01:16:42,076
>> Yes, woo for phased releases,

2497
01:16:42,076 --> 01:16:42,516
come on.

2498
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:44,946
Phased releases means, when you

2499
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:47,156
submit an app, you can choose if

2500
01:16:47,196 --> 01:16:48,546
you want it to be phased over

2501
01:16:48,546 --> 01:16:49,946
time so it doesn't hit your

2502
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:51,556
infrastructure all at once and

2503
01:16:51,556 --> 01:16:52,746
you can see how customers are

2504
01:16:52,746 --> 01:16:54,296
responding to that update.

2505
01:16:54,596 --> 01:16:56,086

2506
01:16:56,086 --> 01:16:57,086
you to take advantage of.

2507
01:16:57,086 --> 01:16:58,566
And there are a lot of things

01:20:11,976 --> 01:20:14,066
friend and what's incredible is

2624
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:15,386
that we can actually all

2625
01:20:15,386 --> 01:20:17,296
download this today, only on the

2626
01:20:17,296 --> 01:20:17,866
App Store.

[ Applause ]

2628
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:24,036
Let's see what else is happening

2629
01:20:24,146 --> 01:20:24,286
today.

2630
01:20:25,066 --> 01:20:28,776
What have we got here?

2631
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:31,006
Here's a how to guide about

2632
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:31,746
VSCO.

2633
01:20:31,746 --> 01:20:32,876
I use this app all the time.

2634
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:34,026
Let's check it out.

2635
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:37,156
This is packed full of useful

2636
01:20:37,156 --> 01:20:37,326
tips.

2637
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,316
So even if you have an app

2638
01:20:39,316 --> 01:20:40,786
already, you still might learn

2639
01:20:40,786 --> 01:20:43,226
something new like I didn't know

2640
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:44,296
you could use it to make

2641
01:20:44,296 --> 01:20:47,626
animated GIFs or GIFs.

2642
01:20:48,996 --> 01:20:51,436
Anyway, you can make them.

2643
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:53,106
I just scroll back up and pull

2644
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:54,906
down on the card and I'm back in

2645
01:20:54,906 --> 01:20:55,366
the feed.

2646
01:20:56,656 --> 01:20:58,036
Every day there's a new app of

2647
01:20:58,036 --> 01:21:00,586
the day and a new game of the

2648
01:21:00,586 --> 01:21:03,126
day and the daily list.

2649
01:21:03,786 --> 01:21:04,806
These are great because they're

2650
01:21:04,886 --> 01:21:06,616
focused on a theme or a goal

2651
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:07,956
like meditation.

2652
01:21:08,736 --> 01:21:10,216
I've actually been trying some

2653
01:21:10,216 --> 01:21:14,366
of these out to get ready for

2654
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:15,836
this and it's totally working.

2655
01:21:16,116 --> 01:21:18,886
If I'm busy and miss a day, I

2656
01:21:18,886 --> 01:21:21,486
can scroll down and see stories

2657
01:21:21,486 --> 01:21:22,536
from earlier in the week.

2658
01:21:23,096 --> 01:21:24,206
So that's the Today tab.

2659
01:21:25,356 --> 01:21:27,926
If I only want to see games, now

2660
01:21:27,926 --> 01:21:29,676
I can go to the New Games tab.

2661
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:31,026
This is huge.

2662
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:31,816
Let's check it out.

2663
01:21:32,216 --> 01:21:33,836
Up at the top I can see the

2664
01:21:33,836 --> 01:21:36,076
biggest new releases or just

2665
01:21:36,196 --> 01:21:37,206
what the game editors are

2666
01:21:37,206 --> 01:21:38,096
playing this week.

2667
01:21:38,096 --> 01:21:40,406
If I scroll down I can watch a

2668
01:21:40,406 --> 01:21:42,196
whole bunch of game videos.

2669
01:21:42,306 --> 01:21:45,076
And it's not just previews but

2670
01:21:45,076 --> 01:21:47,366
also tips and gameplay videos by

2671
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:48,246
editors too.

2672
01:21:48,246 --> 01:21:50,536
If I scroll down, I can see

2673
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:53,056
charts that only feature games.

2674
01:21:53,186 --> 01:21:54,756
So it's really easy to see what

2675
01:21:54,756 --> 01:21:56,266
the most popular games are

2676
01:21:56,516 --> 01:21:59,126
separate from apps.

2677
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:00,696
And now I can browse by game

2678
01:22:00,786 --> 01:22:01,706
categories too.

2679
01:22:03,236 --> 01:22:04,896
This page is just packed full of

2680
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:05,756
recommendations.

2681
01:22:06,306 --> 01:22:07,596
This artsy game looks fun.

2682
01:22:07,826 --> 01:22:08,606
Let's check it out.

2683
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:10,346
I'm going to tap on the icon and

2684
01:22:10,716 --> 01:22:12,916
it opens up a redesigned app

2685
01:22:13,146 --> 01:22:13,586
page.

2686
01:22:13,686 --> 01:22:15,496
It's more beautiful and more

2687
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:16,046
useful.

2688
01:22:16,486 --> 01:22:18,026
I can watch more videos that

2689
01:22:18,026 --> 01:22:19,546
show me how fun this is.

2690
01:22:19,546 --> 01:22:21,656
And this badge at the top tells

2691
01:22:21,696 --> 01:22:23,626
me it was named editor's choice.

2692
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:26,116
If I scroll down, I can see

ratings and reviews front and

2694
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:29,206
center so I can see what other

2695
01:22:29,206 --> 01:22:30,966
customers think before making a

2696
01:22:31,006 --> 01:22:31,346
choice.

2697
01:22:31,866 --> 01:22:34,056
Like this review, it tells me

2698
01:22:34,056 --> 01:22:35,506
this game is great for killing

2699
01:22:35,676 --> 01:22:35,906
time.

For all the incredible apps on

2702
01:22:42,246 --> 01:22:43,906
the store there's a new tab too,

2703
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:44,596
the Apps tab.

2704
01:22:45,036 --> 01:22:45,616
Let's go there.

2705
01:22:46,676 --> 01:22:48,466
It shares the same great design

2706
01:22:48,776 --> 01:22:50,256
as the Games tab but with a

2707
01:22:50,336 --> 01:22:51,646
focus just on apps.

2708

So those are some of the big

2730
01:23:32,926 --> 01:23:35,216
features in iOS 11.

2731
01:23:35,216 --> 01:23:37,026

iOS as well, but there's more

2735
01:23:43,376 --> 01:23:45,806
and it starts with machine

2736
01:23:45,806 --> 01:23:46,186
learning.

2737
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:49,136

01:23:49,186 --> 01:23:50,626
used machine leaning throughout

2739
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,766
the experiences on Apple Watch,

2740
01:23:53,006 --> 01:23:54,256
for instance, and the predictive

2741
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:55,456
Siri watch face.

2742
01:23:56,536 --> 01:23:59,216
We use it on the iPad for palm

2743
01:23:59,216 --> 01:24:00,256
rejection when you're writing

2744
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:01,126
with Apple Pencil.

2745
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:04,706
Of course, we use it to extend

2746
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,046
your battery life by predicting

2747
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:06,906
how you're going to use your

01:24:06,906 --> 01:24:07,486
device.

2749
01:24:08,456 --> 01:24:09,746

Well now, for all of you

2753
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,186

apps.

2757
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:21,496
And we're doing it via set of

01:24:21,846 --> 01:24:22,786
new APIs.

2759
01:24:23,196 --> 01:24:24,766
Starts with the vision API which

2760
01:24:24,766 --> 01:24:26,496
provides face tracking, face

2761
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,926
detection, landmarks, all of

2762
01:24:27,926 --> 01:24:29,206
these core features we use

2763
01:24:29,206 --> 01:24:30,886
inside of our apps.

2764
01:24:31,596 --> 01:24:33,336
And the natural language API

2765
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:35,186
that provides capabilities like

2766
01:24:35,216 --> 01:24:36,836
tokenization and named entity

2767
01:24:36,836 --> 01:24:37,516

Now, these are all built on Core

2769
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:40,626

And Core ML provides high

Next, I'd like to turn to AR.

01:25:32,156 --> 01:25:35,276
Now, with Multi-Touch, it really

2799
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:36,646
changed the way that you

2800

interact with the world on the

screen of your iPhone.

2802
01:25:40,756 --> 01:25:42,346
And with the camera, it allowed

2803
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,496
you to capture the world around

2804

01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:49,586
actually be quite profound.

3179
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:43,796
yourself to appreciate because

3180
01:37:43,796 --> 01:37:45,076
our projection systems just

3181
01:37:45,076 --> 01:37:46,286
aren't capable of doing those

3182
01:37:46,286 --> 01:37:47,276
type of refresh rates.

3183
01:37:47,726 --> 01:37:48,896
But I'll tell you the difference

3184
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:49,706
is dramatic.

3185
01:37:49,706 --> 01:37:51,326
And when you scroll, it's

3186
01:37:51,446 --> 01:37:52,296
buttery smooth.

3187
01:37:53,446 --> 01:37:54,736
Now, the higher refresh rate

3188
01:37:54,736 --> 01:37:56,466
also means it works even better

3189
01:37:56,466 --> 01:37:57,416
with the Apple Pencil.

3190
01:37:57,696 --> 01:37:58,836
We already have the

3191
01:37:58,836 --> 01:38:00,366
industry-leading performance for

3192
01:38:00,366 --> 01:38:01,726
drawing and writing with the

3193
01:38:01,726 --> 01:38:02,726
Apple Pencil, but with

3194
01:38:02,726 --> 01:38:04,316
ProMotion, it gets even better.

3195
01:38:05,206 --> 01:38:06,516
It's more responsive and it

3196
01:38:06,516 --> 01:38:07,936
reduces our latency to an

3197
01:38:07,936 --> 01:38:10,566
industry best 20 milliseconds.

3198
01:38:11,516 --> 01:38:14,826
[ Applause ]

3199
01:38:15,326 --> 01:38:17,206
So drawing is incredibly fluid

3200
01:38:17,206 --> 01:38:18,626
and even more natural, you're

3201
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:20,486
going to love using the Apple

3202
01:38:20,486 --> 01:38:22,166
Pencil of the new iPad Pro.

3203
01:38:22,436 --> 01:38:23,446
Another breakthrough of

3204
01:38:23,446 --> 01:38:25,076
ProMotion is that these become

3205
01:38:25,076 --> 01:38:26,516
the first mobile displays to be

3206
01:38:26,516 --> 01:38:28,266
able to dynamically adjust the

3207
01:38:28,266 --> 01:38:29,926
refresh rate, depending on what

3208
01:38:29,926 --> 01:38:30,956
you're looking at.

3209
01:38:30,956 --> 01:38:31,966
This is a really big

3210
01:38:31,966 --> 01:38:33,166
breakthrough for both display

3211
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:35,416
quality, as well as for power

3212
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:35,876
savings.

3213
01:38:36,356 --> 01:38:37,686
So when you have dash-moving

3214
01:38:37,686 --> 01:38:38,826
content, they can update

3215
01:38:38,826 --> 01:38:39,306
quickly.

3216
01:38:40,056 --> 01:38:42,266
But they can also update slower

3217
01:38:42,266 --> 01:38:43,516
when you don't need that type of

3218
01:38:43,516 --> 01:38:44,016
refresh rate.

3219
01:38:44,016 --> 01:38:45,816
For example, a still image, this

3220
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:46,886
allows us to save a lot of

3221
01:38:46,886 --> 01:38:47,926
energy and give you better

3222
01:38:47,926 --> 01:38:48,656
battery life.

3223
01:38:49,406 --> 01:38:50,606
So, hopefully you see why these

3224
01:38:50,606 --> 01:38:52,176
are not just the best displays

3225
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,006
that we've ever made, but we

3226
01:38:54,006 --> 01:38:54,996
think they're the most advanced

3227
01:38:55,026 --> 01:38:56,026
displays in the planet.

3228
01:38:57,516 --> 01:38:58,506
Next, let's talk about

3229
01:38:58,506 --> 01:38:58,976
performance.

3230
01:39:00,296 --> 01:39:02,296
iPad is already best in class

3231
01:39:02,296 --> 01:39:03,046
for performance.

3232
01:39:03,436 --> 01:39:04,466
But we're not resting on our

3233
01:39:04,466 --> 01:39:05,066
laurels.

3234
01:39:05,656 --> 01:39:07,406
These are the fastest we've ever

3235
01:39:07,406 --> 01:39:07,906
created.

3236
01:39:08,496 --> 01:39:10,066
Inside them, they're powered by

3237
01:39:10,066 --> 01:39:12,756
the A10X Fusion chip.

3238
01:39:12,756 --> 01:39:15,506
The A10X has a six-core CPU,

3239
01:39:15,546 --> 01:39:16,886
three high-performance cores,

3240
01:39:17,216 --> 01:39:18,716
three high-efficiency cores, all

3241
01:39:18,716 --> 01:39:20,406
automatically managed by the

3242

Apple performance controller.

3243
01:39:22,826 --> 01:39:25,406
It also has a 12-core GPU.

3244
01:39:25,676 --> 01:39:27,616
This is a powerhouse.

3245
01:39:28,116 --> 01:39:30,946
And it delivers 30% faster CPU

3246
01:39:30,946 --> 01:39:32,926
performance over our already

3247
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:35,666
industry leading A9X and 40%

3248
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:37,836
faster graphics performance.

3250
01:39:43,596 --> 01:39:45,416
Our chip team has done just an

3251
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:47,646
amazing job over the years with

3252
01:39:47,646 --> 01:39:48,806
the performance improvements and

3253
01:39:48,806 --> 01:39:50,206
results have been staggering.

3254
01:39:50,546 --> 01:39:51,146

01:39:51,146 --> 01:39:52,296
industry-leading graphics

3256
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:54,596
performance that's more than 500

01:39:54,596 --> 01:39:56,086
times the original iPad from

3258
01:39:56,086 --> 01:39:57,646
just a few years ago.

3259
01:39:58,866 --> 01:40:00,636
But of course, numbers only tell

3260
01:40:00,636 --> 01:40:01,426
part of the story.

3261
01:40:02,186 --> 01:40:03,396
To demonstrate the real-world

3262
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:04,776
performance of the A10X in the

3263
01:40:04,776 --> 01:40:06,896

01:40:16,006 --> 01:40:16,406
>> Thanks, Joz.

3271
01:40:18,926 --> 01:40:19,986
So I'm thrilled today to be able

3272
01:40:19,986 --> 01:40:21,396
to show you the iPad version of

3273
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:22,206
Affinity Photo.

3274
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:24,056
This is a truly high-end

3275
01:40:24,126 --> 01:40:25,876
professional photo editing tool.

3276
01:40:26,256 --> 01:40:28,306
And on this latest iPad Pro, we

3277
01:40:28,306 --> 01:40:29,116
can achieve levels of

3278
01:40:29,116 --> 01:40:30,676
performance which is simply

3279
01:40:30,676 --> 01:40:32,486
unattainable on any other

3280
01:40:32,786 --> 01:40:33,176
device.

3281
01:40:33,176 --> 01:40:33,926
And I'm going to try and show

3282
01:40:33,926 --> 01:40:35,536
you that today by creating a

3283
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:36,286
movie poster.

3284
01:40:36,286 --> 01:40:37,136
I've already set up a few

3285
01:40:37,136 --> 01:40:37,466
layers.

3286
01:40:37,466 --> 01:40:38,286
I've kind of got this great

3287
01:40:38,286 --> 01:40:39,636
background of some stormy sky.

3288
01:40:39,636 --> 01:40:41,666
I've got a turbulent sea and

3289
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:42,156
this ship.

3290
01:40:42,466 --> 01:40:43,116
Now, the first thing you'll

3291
01:40:43,116 --> 01:40:44,276
notice when you're using this is

3292
01:40:44,276 --> 01:40:45,486
as you're kind of moving layers

3293
01:40:45,486 --> 01:40:47,576
around, rotating them or even

3294
01:40:47,576 --> 01:40:49,736
just sort of panning and zooming

3295
01:40:49,736 --> 01:40:51,336
around your work, I'm seeing all

3296
01:40:51,336 --> 01:40:53,336
of these now at 120 frames a

3297
01:40:53,336 --> 01:40:53,696
second.

3298
01:40:53,696 --> 01:40:54,946
So it just feels incredibly

3299
01:40:55,006 --> 01:40:55,426
smooth.

3300
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:57,106
But when you come to edit

3301
01:40:57,106 --> 01:40:59,506
layers, because of Metal, we can

3302
01:40:59,506 --> 01:41:00,576
achieve performance more than

3303
01:41:00,706 --> 01:41:04,166
four times than i7 quad core

3304
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:04,986
desktop PC.

3305
01:41:04,986 --> 01:41:06,436
And I'll show you what that

3306
01:41:06,436 --> 01:41:06,766
means.

3307
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:08,416
On this sea, I'm going to apply

3308
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,576
a 12 filter.

3309
01:41:09,906 --> 01:41:11,606
And look, just with my finger, I

3310
01:41:11,606 --> 01:41:13,226
can kind of push this sea

3311
01:41:13,226 --> 01:41:14,376
around, or I can even just like

3312
01:41:14,376 --> 01:41:16,776
flick away right over the side

3313
01:41:16,776 --> 01:41:17,696
of the ship.

3314
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:19,566
It's a totally new way to kind

3315
01:41:19,566 --> 01:41:21,676
of interact with your designs.

3316
01:41:22,146 --> 01:41:23,206
And actually, everything is this

3317
01:41:23,206 --> 01:41:23,326
fast.

3318
01:41:23,326 --> 01:41:25,456
So let's-- So I wanted to set

3319
01:41:25,456 --> 01:41:27,716
this ship on fire, for example.

3320
01:41:28,116 --> 01:41:29,366
I've got this fire up all here.

3321
01:41:29,456 --> 01:41:30,666
I can move this over the back of

3322
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:31,006
the ship.

3323
01:41:31,006 --> 01:41:31,906
But to make that look more

3324
01:41:31,906 --> 01:41:33,886
realistic, I need to apply blend

3325
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:34,096
mode.

3326
01:41:34,096 --> 01:41:35,796
Now normally, blend modes is

3327
01:41:35,796 --> 01:41:36,836
something that takes a lot of

3328
01:41:36,836 --> 01:41:37,376
trial and error.

3329
01:41:37,376 --> 01:41:38,816
But now, look at this.

3330
01:41:38,816 --> 01:41:40,166
So I can just scrub down here

3331
01:41:40,546 --> 01:41:42,036
and I'll get an instant preview

3332
01:41:42,036 --> 01:41:42,936
of all the different blend

3333
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:43,106
modes.

3334
01:41:43,106 --> 01:41:44,036
So it makes it really, really

3335
01:41:44,036 --> 01:41:45,926
easy to select the right blend

3336
01:41:45,926 --> 01:41:47,256
modes that I want.

3337
01:41:47,256 --> 01:41:49,306
Now of course, everything I've

3338
01:41:49,306 --> 01:41:50,556
done so far, I've done using

3339
01:41:50,556 --> 01:41:50,956
touch.

3340
01:41:50,956 --> 01:41:52,606
But with iPad Pro, we have the

3341
01:41:52,656 --> 01:41:54,246
best stylus that's ever been

3342
01:41:54,246 --> 01:41:54,576
made.

3343
01:41:54,726 --> 01:41:56,256
And we can do some great stuff

3344
01:41:56,256 --> 01:41:57,326
with Apple Pencil, too.

3345
01:41:57,606 --> 01:41:59,196
A really good example of that is

3346
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:00,206
our lighting filter.

3347
01:42:00,326 --> 01:42:01,556
So here, I'll choose lighting,

3348
01:42:02,446 --> 01:42:03,346
and make that a bit bigger.

3349
01:42:03,606 --> 01:42:04,936
And look, I can actually control

3350
01:42:04,936 --> 01:42:06,816
now the angle and the tilt of

3351
01:42:06,816 --> 01:42:08,866
that light using Apple Pencil.

3352
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:10,576
There's no latency, whatsoever.

3353
01:42:10,576 --> 01:42:12,356
So it's a really immersive way

3354
01:42:12,806 --> 01:42:13,376
to work.

3355
01:42:13,376 --> 01:42:15,916
Now, I said at the start, I was

3356
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:17,486
creating a movie poster.

3357
01:42:17,486 --> 01:42:18,576
And in fact, what I'm actually

3358
01:42:18,576 --> 01:42:19,926
doing is creating a pirate movie

3359
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:20,316
poster.

3360
01:42:20,316 --> 01:42:21,436
So now, I need a pirate.

3361
01:42:21,946 --> 01:42:22,846
And I've got Captain Jack

3362
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:23,506
Sparrow here.

3363
01:42:23,506 --> 01:42:25,256
But at the moment, of course,

3364
01:42:25,256 --> 01:42:26,616
he's on the wrong background.

3365
01:42:26,616 --> 01:42:27,666
So what I need to do is cut him

3366
01:42:27,666 --> 01:42:27,846
out.

3367
01:42:27,846 --> 01:42:28,666
And I'm going to use some

3368
01:42:28,666 --> 01:42:29,896
selection tool to do that.

3369
01:42:29,896 --> 01:42:30,646
So, to start with, I'm just

3370
01:42:30,646 --> 01:42:31,996
going to do-- and you can see

3371
01:42:31,996 --> 01:42:33,806
how quick it is to do a really

3372
01:42:33,996 --> 01:42:35,906
quick selection with pencil to

3373
01:42:35,906 --> 01:42:37,146
sort of snap around the edges.

3374
01:42:37,456 --> 01:42:38,496
But of course, with selections,

3375
01:42:38,496 --> 01:42:39,676
what often happens is you need

3376
01:42:39,676 --> 01:42:40,686
to do a much more accurate

3377
01:42:40,686 --> 01:42:41,726
selection around hair.

3378
01:42:41,726 --> 01:42:42,656
And to do that, we're going to

3379
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:43,816
do a selection refinement.

3380
01:42:44,276 --> 01:42:45,226
This is something that takes a

3381
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:47,266
huge amount of CPU power, but on

3382
01:42:47,266 --> 01:42:48,886
this latest iPad, it's twice as

3383
01:42:48,886 --> 01:42:49,946
fast as ever before.

3384
01:42:50,236 --> 01:42:51,266
And you can see pretty much

3385
01:42:51,306 --> 01:42:52,636
instantly, I'll get a selection

3386
01:42:52,636 --> 01:42:54,046
down to individual strands of

3387
01:42:54,046 --> 01:42:54,326
hair.

3392
01:43:06,826 --> 01:43:08,916
I can hold in my hands.

3393
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:10,946
It's really incredible.

3394
01:43:11,116 --> 01:43:12,316
I really think that iPad Pro,

3395
01:43:12,366 --> 01:43:14,446
alongside Affinity Photo, is a

3396
01:43:14,446 --> 01:43:16,146
truly game-changing experience

3397
01:43:16,146 --> 01:43:17,376
for professional photo editing.

3398
01:43:17,376 --> 01:43:18,226
And the best thing of all is

3399
01:43:18,226 --> 01:43:19,646
that you can now experience it

3400
01:43:19,646 --> 01:43:21,436
now, because I'm delighted to

3401
01:43:21,546 --> 01:43:23,236
announce that Affinity Photo for

3402
01:43:23,286 --> 01:43:24,736

>> Wow. Thank you, Ash.

3407
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:36,206
That's amazing performance,

3408
01:43:36,206 --> 01:43:37,436
again, especially for a device

3409
01:43:37,436 --> 01:43:38,956
that's so thin and light in a

3410
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:40,226
simple one-pound package you

3411
01:43:40,226 --> 01:43:41,386
could take with you everywhere

3412
01:43:41,386 --> 01:43:41,816
you go.

3413
01:43:42,646 --> 01:43:44,056
And what's also cool is despite

3414
01:43:44,096 --> 01:43:45,486
all this performance to new,

3415
01:43:45,806 --> 01:43:48,036
iPad Pro still delivers the same

all day 10-hour battery life

3417
01:43:49,736 --> 01:43:50,996
that our iPad users love.

01:43:51,446 --> 01:43:53,956
Next, let's talk about cameras.

3419
01:43:54,766 --> 01:43:56,896
The new iPad Pro features the

3420
01:43:56,896 --> 01:43:58,396
latest camera system from our

3421
01:43:58,396 --> 01:43:59,066
iPhone 7.

3422
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,536
That means the same high

3423
01:44:00,656 --> 01:44:03,396
performance 12 megapixel sensor

stabilization.

3426
01:44:05,466 --> 01:44:07,376
And it has the ability to even

3427
01:44:07,706 --> 01:44:09,576
capture and, of course, edit 4K

3428

3429
01:44:10,816 --> 01:44:12,016
They're absolutely fantastic

3441
01:44:29,996 --> 01:44:32,696
The iPad Pro supports USB 3,

3442
01:44:33,006 --> 01:44:33,896
which means that you're going to

3443
01:44:33,896 --> 01:44:35,906
get faster transfers with your

3444
01:44:35,906 --> 01:44:37,276

64 gigs will now be at $649 and

3480

We are taking iOS to the next

level.

bottom of the screen, it is more

powerful than ever.

what you're going to use next

01:47:01,096 --> 01:47:03,016
including your continuity apps.

3526
01:47:03,436 --> 01:47:05,126

from anywhere right from the

01:53:21,986 --> 01:53:24,036
really great way to mark up

3734
01:53:24,036 --> 01:53:25,536
anything and share it.

3735
01:53:25,836 --> 01:53:26,916
We know, a lot of people do like

3736
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:29,076
to share with screenshots, and

3737
01:53:29,106 --> 01:53:30,056
so now when you take a

3738
01:53:30,056 --> 01:53:31,786
screenshot, we'll create a

3739
01:53:31,786 --> 01:53:33,036
thumbnail down in the bottom of

3740
01:53:33,036 --> 01:53:33,306
the screen.

3741
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,356
If you tap it, you go instantly

3742
01:53:35,356 --> 01:53:37,506
in the markup, you can mark it

3743
01:53:37,506 --> 01:53:39,356
up right there and share it.

3744
01:53:39,846 --> 01:53:41,746
Now, we've all-- It's really

3745
01:53:41,746 --> 01:53:41,926
cool.

[ Applause ]

3747
01:53:46,086 --> 01:53:47,356
Now, we've also integrated

3748
01:53:47,356 --> 01:53:49,646
Pencil deeply into Notes.

3749
01:53:49,796 --> 01:53:51,076
So if you're working on a note

3750
01:53:51,076 --> 01:53:52,216
and later you're at the lock

3751
01:53:52,216 --> 01:53:53,216

3752
01:53:53,216 --> 01:53:54,806
just a tap of the pencil to lock

3755
01:53:57,686 --> 01:53:58,726
And we've made your note

3756
01:53:58,966 --> 01:54:01,026
handwritten text searchable.

3757
01:54:01,026 --> 01:54:02,476
So we can now search handwriting

3758
01:54:02,476 --> 01:54:03,616
and we use deep learning to

3759
01:54:03,616 --> 01:54:05,096
recognize what you write.

3760
01:54:05,896 --> 01:54:07,936
And if you're doing primarily

3761
01:54:08,016 --> 01:54:10,006
typed notes, you can now also do

3762
01:54:10,006 --> 01:54:12,236
inline drawings, right there.

3763
01:54:12,236 --> 01:54:15,306
It's very handy.

Now of course, sometimes we

3766
01:54:19,336 --> 01:54:20,596
still have to deal with paper,

3767
01:54:20,866 --> 01:54:22,596
so Notes now has a built-in

3768
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:23,796
document scanner.

3769
01:54:23,796 --> 01:54:25,756
It can correct perspective and

01:54:25,756 --> 01:54:26,456
contrast.

3771
01:54:28,006 --> 01:54:29,166
And when you bring the note in,

3772
01:54:30,346 --> 01:54:31,616
you can mark it up, write with

3773
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:31,976

Well, the first thing I want to

3790
01:54:59,306 --> 01:55:01,046
show you is a quick way of

3791
01:55:01,046 --> 01:55:03,026
getting to your notes using your

3792
01:55:03,026 --> 01:55:03,726
Apple Pencil.

3793
01:55:04,736 --> 01:55:06,206
You just tap on the lock screen

3794
01:55:06,206 --> 01:55:08,566
like this and it slides up to

3795
01:55:08,566 --> 01:55:10,136
reveal your notes beneath it.

3796
01:55:10,726 --> 01:55:11,856
Now you can see here I've got a

3797
01:55:12,046 --> 01:55:13,546
handwritten note and I want to

3798
01:55:13,546 --> 01:55:14,936
show you how easy it is to

3799
01:55:14,936 --> 01:55:17,036
create one of these.

3800
01:55:17,036 --> 01:55:18,206
Watch at the top of the note

3801
01:55:18,206 --> 01:55:19,556
here as I edit the title.

3802
01:55:19,916 --> 01:55:21,356
Just by putting the pencil down

3803
01:55:21,856 --> 01:55:24,876
and writing like this, after the

3804
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:29,076
2017 keynote.

3805
01:55:30,216 --> 01:55:31,526
It's as natural as putting

3806
01:55:31,526 --> 01:55:32,576
pencil to paper.

3807
01:55:33,156 --> 01:55:34,626
Now something paper can't help

01:55:34,626 --> 01:55:35,986
you with is finding your notes

3809
01:55:35,986 --> 01:55:36,776
again later.

3810
01:55:37,276 --> 01:55:38,636

3811
01:55:38,636 --> 01:55:40,666
recognize your handwriting and

3812
01:55:40,666 --> 01:55:42,016
index it in Spotlight.

3814

This is a note that my young

3835
01:56:19,476 --> 01:56:20,826
daughter shared with me as part

3836
01:56:20,826 --> 01:56:22,826
of a school assignment where she

3837
01:56:22,826 --> 01:56:24,086
had to work with her parents to

3838
01:56:24,086 --> 01:56:26,056
develop an idea for a new app.

3839
01:56:26,696 --> 01:56:27,886
Now, she asked me how many

3840
01:56:27,886 --> 01:56:29,346
copies of our app I thought I

3841
01:56:29,346 --> 01:56:31,376
might sell-- We might sell.

3842
01:56:31,376 --> 01:56:32,976
And so, I want to quickly draw a

3843
01:56:32,976 --> 01:56:35,056
graph to give her some idea of

3844
01:56:35,056 --> 01:56:35,146
that.

3845
01:56:35,146 --> 01:56:36,986
I'm just going to press down

3846
01:56:36,986 --> 01:56:38,116
here with the pencil to make

3847
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:40,576
some space for my drawing and

3848
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,536
then we can take that little

3849
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:43,446
grabber and open up some more

3851
01:56:44,066 --> 01:56:46,696
Now, I am really bad at drawing

3852
01:56:46,796 --> 01:56:48,406
but I just love doing it.

3853
01:56:48,776 --> 01:56:50,026
And what's great about drawing

3854
01:56:50,026 --> 01:56:51,956
on the iPad is it works the same

3855
01:56:51,956 --> 01:56:53,376
way as it does with paper.

3856
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,286
And that means it's really easy

3857
01:56:55,396 --> 01:56:56,986
for me to draw really badly

3862
01:57:06,486 --> 01:57:07,936
It's so simple, and I think

3863
01:57:07,936 --> 01:57:09,376
you're going to have a lot of

3864
01:57:09,376 --> 01:57:10,916
fun rediscovering the joy of

3868
01:57:15,996 --> 01:57:17,266
things from me about how Apple

3869
01:57:17,266 --> 01:57:17,646

01:57:17,646 --> 01:57:19,066
And before I left this morning,

3871
01:57:19,276 --> 01:57:21,106
she gave me an NDA to sign.

document scanner notes and my

3874
01:57:26,616 --> 01:57:28,566

3876
01:57:29,106 --> 01:57:31,216
We'll just tap the plus button

3877
01:57:31,216 --> 01:57:32,456
here to bring up the document

3878
01:57:32,456 --> 01:57:34,536

3879
01:57:34,536 --> 01:57:36,336
point the camera at the piece of

3880
01:57:36,336 --> 01:57:36,876

3892
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,676

01:57:58,676 --> 01:57:59,156
my demo.

3894
01:57:59,156 --> 01:58:00,916
So if you'll excuse me, I'm just

3895
01:58:00,916 --> 01:58:01,946
going to tap on that and see

3896
01:58:01,946 --> 01:58:03,036
what she has to say.

01:58:03,926 --> 01:58:06,506
Wow, an offer for $100 million

3898
01:58:06,506 --> 01:58:07,916
is really pretty thrilling.

3899
01:58:08,516 --> 01:58:10,256
I need to send this to my wife

3900

right away.

3901
01:58:11,096 --> 01:58:12,656
I'm going to take a screenshot

3902
01:58:12,656 --> 01:58:14,536
of this and then we'll tap on

3903
01:58:14,536 --> 01:58:16,356

up the share sheet to send it

4078
02:06:04,856 --> 02:06:06,706
They're precision acoustic horns

4268
02:12:09,706 --> 02:12:11,346
most in a product like HomePod,

4269
02:12:11,346 --> 02:12:12,636

give you news, give you weather,

4273
02:12:17,626 --> 02:12:18,896

4274
02:12:18,896 --> 02:12:20,206

coin, remind me to bring snacks

4288
02:12:45,596 --> 02:12:46,226
to a party.

4289
02:12:46,806 --> 02:12:49,106
You can set up reminders, check

4290
02:12:49,106 --> 02:12:50,646
all the sports news and weather,

4291
02:12:51,006 --> 02:12:52,416
all directly with your voice,

4292
02:12:52,656 --> 02:12:53,846
talk to a HomePod that gets the

4293
02:12:53,846 --> 02:12:55,496
information directly from the

4294
02:12:55,496 --> 02:12:55,926
cloud.

4295
02:12:55,996 --> 02:12:58,196
And if you have HomeKit devices

4296
02:12:58,196 --> 02:12:59,826
set up, you can say simple

4297
02:12:59,826 --> 02:13:01,556
things like, are the lights on,

4298
02:13:01,896 --> 02:13:03,776
turn the heat up, turn on the

4299
02:13:03,776 --> 02:13:05,396
air conditioning, bring the

4300
02:13:05,396 --> 02:13:08,026
shades down halfway, turn off

4301
02:13:08,026 --> 02:13:09,456
the lights in the bedroom.

4302
02:13:10,076 --> 02:13:11,466
And if you've set up scenes in

4303
02:13:11,466 --> 02:13:12,736
HomeKit you can control those as

4304
02:13:12,736 --> 02:13:13,146
well.

4305
02:13:13,356 --> 02:13:14,696
You can say, "I'm home.

4306
02:13:15,146 --> 02:13:16,036
It's movie time.

4307
02:13:16,036 --> 02:13:17,466
I'm leaving now."

4308
02:13:17,466 --> 02:13:18,696
And the whole scene can

4309
02:13:18,696 --> 02:13:20,996
automatically happen just by

4310
02:13:20,996 --> 02:13:22,316
talking to your HomePod.

4311
02:13:23,126 --> 02:13:26,366
And because there is a HomePod

4312
02:13:26,366 --> 02:13:27,756
base-- the HomeKit base built

4313
02:13:27,756 --> 02:13:29,446
into HomePod, that means

4314
02:13:29,446 --> 02:13:30,896
anywhere in the world, once you

4315
02:13:30,896 --> 02:13:32,286
set up your first HomePod, you

4316
02:13:32,286 --> 02:13:34,116
control your HomeKit devices

4317
02:13:34,116 --> 02:13:35,906
remotely using the built-in Home

4318
02:13:35,906 --> 02:13:38,066
app on your iPhone or iPad.

4319
02:13:38,066 --> 02:13:41,266
Now, setting up a HomePod and

4320
02:13:41,266 --> 02:13:42,886
its microphone array in your

4321
02:13:42,886 --> 02:13:44,016
home, you probably have a

4322
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:44,926
question that we've worked

4323
02:13:45,306 --> 02:13:46,736
really hard to deal with, which

4324
02:13:46,736 --> 02:13:47,706
is privacy.

4325
02:13:48,046 --> 02:13:49,916
Our team cares deeply about your

4326
02:13:49,916 --> 02:13:50,686
privacy.

4327
02:13:51,106 --> 02:13:52,996
So for example, it has that

4328
02:13:52,996 --> 02:13:54,456
magic phrase, hey Siri.

4329
02:13:54,656 --> 02:13:56,776
Until you say it, nothing is

4330
02:13:56,776 --> 02:13:57,626
being sent to Apple.

4331
02:13:58,866 --> 02:14:00,756
It recognizes when you do say it

4332
02:14:00,756 --> 02:14:02,056
and from that point it sends an

4333
02:14:02,086 --> 02:14:04,366
anonymous Siri ID in order to

4334
02:14:04,366 --> 02:14:05,496
help you with the command you're

4335
02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:06,116
looking for.

4336
02:14:06,116 --> 02:14:07,936
And of course that communication

4337
02:14:08,246 --> 02:14:09,436
is all encrypted.

4338
02:14:09,906 --> 02:14:12,406
So this is the HomePod.

4339
02:14:12,846 --> 02:14:14,106
It's a breakthrough home

4340
02:14:14,106 --> 02:14:14,926
speaker.

4341
02:14:16,256 --> 02:14:18,176
Typically Wi-Fi speakers, if

4342
02:14:18,176 --> 02:14:20,756
they're a good quality, of $300

4343
02:14:20,756 --> 02:14:22,936
to $500.

4344
02:14:22,936 --> 02:14:24,306
And a smart speaker might cost

4345
02:14:24,306 --> 02:14:26,306
you $100 to $200.

4346
02:14:27,126 --> 02:14:28,256
So it's not unreasonable for a

4347
02:14:28,256 --> 02:14:29,396
HomePod to be priced in the

4348
02:14:29,396 --> 02:14:32,266
range of $400 to $700.

4349
02:14:33,086 --> 02:14:34,666
So we're really excited to tell

4350
02:14:34,666 --> 02:14:36,546
you that HomePod is going to be

4351
02:14:36,546 --> 02:14:38,976
priced for $349.
